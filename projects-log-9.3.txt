How to show jupyter notebooks on website?  
HTML viewer for non-coders, HR people.  
Github for clone, but also download from website, so don't need to clone whole repo.  
Mayve move all non-website file out again?  

Maybe a separate repo just for project notebooks???  
With MyBinder and CoLab option  
With related files somehow open in Colab notebooks.  
Public data file link: can use datasciY, already have public URL.  
Or AWS S3 public bucket, just for data - pay for transfer out fee.  

 * Also create collapsing headings - for subprojects.
