### Step 1: Accessing Colab  

First of all you should sign in to you Google account if you are not signed in by default. You must do this step before opening Colab, otherwise the notebooks will not work. You can sign in here.

https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true

Next, head on to the Colab Welcome Page and click on ‘Github’. In the ‘Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user’ line enter **‘fastai/course-v3’**. You will see all the courses notebooks listed there. Click on the one you are interested in using.

You should see your notebook displayed now. Before running anything, you need to tell Colab that you are interested in using a **GPU**. You can do this by clicking on the ‘Runtime’ tab and selecting ‘Change runtime type’. A pop-up window will open up with a drop-down menu. Select ‘GPU’ from the menu and click ‘Save’.
(Seems a lot faster with GPU than CPU or NONE in acceleration)

### Step 2:  Configuring your notebook instance  

Before you start using your notebook, you need to install the necessary packages. You can do this by **creating a code cell, and running**:

  !curl -s https://course.fast.ai/setup/colab | bash

When you run the first cell, you will face a pop-up saying ‘Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google’; you should leave the default tick in the ‘Reset all runtimes before running’ check box and click on ‘Run Anyway’.

### Step 3:  Saving your notebook  

Before you start using your notebook, you need to install the necessary packages. You can do this by creating a code cell, and running:

  !curl -s https://course.fast.ai/setup/colab | bash

When you run the first cell, you will face a pop-up saying ‘Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google’; you should leave the default tick in the ‘Reset all runtimes before running’ check box and click on ‘Run Anyway’.

### Step 4: Saving your data files  

If you run a script which creates/ downloads files, the files will NOT persist after the allocated instance is shutdown. To save files, you need to permit your Colaboratory instance to read and write files to your Google Drive. Add the following code snippet **at the beginning of every notebook**.

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive', force_remount=True)
root_dir = "/content/gdrive/My Drive/"
base_dir = root_dir + 'fastai-v3/'

Now, you may access your Google Drive as a file sytem using standard python commands to both read and write files. Don’t forget to append base_dir before root path(s) in all notebooks. For example, in lesson2-download.ipynb 5th cell, make the following changes:

path = Path(base_dir + 'data/bears')
dest = path/folder
dest.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
