- for uploading to datasciY.com  
 
## Author:  Jennifer E Yoon  

#### 2018 Fastai v0.7  

  * Practical Deep Learning for Coders (2018 fastai v0.7)  
    https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/courses/dl1
    
    * Has cifar 10 image classification example -- to do & upload to website.  
      https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl1/cifar10-simplenet.ipynb  
      Notebook Does NOT load on Github.  Run on other servers.
 
    * There are multiple versions of 2018 fastai class for deep learning part 1.  
       - Full notebooks are only available as part of courses repo:  
         https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/courses     
 
  * Cutting Edge Deep Learning 2018 - Part 2  
    https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/courses/dl2
    
  * Machine Learning for Coders (2018 fastai v0.7)  
    * https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/courses/ml1 
    
  * Math - Linear Algebra for ML 

#### 2019 Fastai v1.0 modules

  * Practical Deep Learning for Coders (Part 1, 2019 fastai v1.0) 
  * Fundamentals of Deep Learning (Part 2, 2019 fastai v1.0))

>DL1 makes extensive use of custon library and functions in fastai v 1.0.  Not easy to translate this to standard libraries.  Just watch the videos and follow along for the concept.  Need to takde DL2 in order to see what is going on from scratch. 

#### My My Fork on Github does NOT merge with Source/Upstream Github account's repo.  

 * First clone on laptop with upstream source repo, i.e., fastai's github URL.
 * Pull from source to my laptop master branch. (download all changed files)
 * Merge with my working files in my own master branch.
 * Push to my own Forked (fastai) repo on MY OWN Github Accout.

>Commits made to my fork does not count towards Github contributions graph, bad!

#### Tasks - Date 8/7/2019  6:40 PM EST  

 * Keep full fastai repo on my account, to push updates to.
 * Manually upload fastai exercise for uploading to my website, datasciY.com
 
#### Tasks - 8/11/2019 12:17 PM  

 * Uploaded CoLab folder from Google Drive 
 * Has Fastai exercise notebook.
 * Do timeing test, get faster GPU to test on.

  
#### Tasks -- 8/18/2019  5:44 PM  

  * Markdown -- learn a few more format items each week.  
  * Github -- look into "rebase" and "merging" 2 upstream soruces.  Test it out.
  * Git -- also practice using branches.  Different ones for different small projects.
  * Jupyter Notebook (Lab) -- Learn a few keyboard shortcuts each week.
  * Become faster and accurate typist -- each small bug from typing error takes 30 minutes to hours to find and fix!
