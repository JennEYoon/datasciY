## My exercise and practice doing fast.ai classes - for uploading to datasciY.com  

#### 2018 Fastai v0.7  

  * Machine Learning for Coders (2018 fastai v0.7)
  
  * Practical Deep Learning for Coders (2018 fastai v0.7)
    * Has cifar 10 image classification example -- to do & upload to website.
  * Math - Linear Algebra for ML 

#### 2019 Fastai v1.0 modules:

  * Practical Deep Learning for Coders (Part 1, 2019 fastai v1.0) 
  * Fundamentals of Deep Learning (Part 2, 2019 fastai v1.0))

>DL1 makes extensive use of custon library and functions in fastai v 1.0.  Not easy to translate this to standard libraries.  Just watch the videos and follow along for the concept.  Need to takde DL2 in order to see what is going on from scratch. 

#### My My Fork on Github does NOT merge with Source/Upstream Github account's repo.  

 * First clone on laptop with upstream source repo, i.e., fastai's github URL.
 * Pull from source to my laptop master branch. (download all changed files)
 * Merge with my working files in my own master branch.
 * Push to my own Forked (fastai) repo on MY OWN Github Accout.

>Commits made to my fork does not count towards Github contributions graph, bad!

### Tasks - Date 8/7/2019  6:40 PM EST  

 * Keep full fastai repo on my account, to push updates to.
 * Manually upload fastai exercise for uploading to my website, datasciY.com
