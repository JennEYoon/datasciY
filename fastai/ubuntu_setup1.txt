#  Ubuntu setup on my Windows 10 machines under WSL.  


====== Notes ====================================================
Ubuntu WSL can now be accesses from File Explorer!

One of the biggest benefits of this change is file handling. Previously, Windows could only modify files on the Ubuntu file system, but not create. Now, by using \\wsl$\Ubuntu in the address bar of your file explorer, one can directly access any Linux-based file, create additional ones, or remove them and the changes will be seen on the Linux-side as well.

Win: Windows key 
Search: Win + s 
Run: Win + r 

File Explorer:  \\wsl$\Ubuntu

=========== Ubuntu setup 8/25/2019 ===============

Reinstalled conda3 linux version to $home/jyoon/conda3 location.
Auto-activates base conda3 upon terminal startup.

 * Firefox browser on Ubuntu -- installed, but windows open function does not work.
 * tensorflow CPU version installed -- but tensorflow-datasets datasets does not work.
 * Can use ROKU-TV as wireless 3rd monitor -- but resolution is too low.
 * Switched to Apple keyboard bluetooth.  Replaced batteries.  Control-key is 2nd left, need to adjust to it.
   Control-C/V, keep hitting wrong key.
