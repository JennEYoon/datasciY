#  Ubuntu setup on my Windows 10 machines under WSL.  


====== Notes ====================================================
Ubuntu WSL can now be accesses from File Explorer!

One of the biggest benefits of this change is file handling. 
Previously, Windows could only modify files on the Ubuntu file system, 
but not create. Now, by using \\wsl$\Ubuntu in the address bar of your 
file explorer, one can directly access any Linux-based file, create 
additional ones, or remove them and the changes will be seen on the 
Linux-side as well.

Win: Windows key (clover key on Apple keyboard)
Search: Win + s 
Run: Win + r 
File Explorer:  \\wsl$\Ubuntu

Apple keyboard:  Command-clover-key is Win key.
Option-alt key + Tab, to cycle through apps
Control key: is 2nd from left-bottom corner.

In Ubuntu terminal: Shift+Control + C/V to cut and paste
Mouse: Click and Shift+click to select line
Mouse Drag: click-hold to lock, then click again to release lock, 
before cut (control+shift+X).

=========== Ubuntu setup 8/25/2019 ===============

Reinstalled conda3 linux version to $home/jyoon/conda3 location.
Auto-activates base conda3 upon terminal startup.

sudo password is my usual 4digits

------------------------------
Installing firefox:

jyoon@Asus-S510:/opt$ firefox
Error: no DISPLAY environment variable specified

Need xhost

jyoon@Asus-S510:~$ xhost +

Command 'xhost' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo apt install x11-xserver-utils
-----------

In conda3 base: 
Installed packages

jupyter notebook (includes ipython shell)
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (includes scipy, statsmodels), pillow, 
pytorch, tensorflow, tensorflow-datasets.  h5py for deeplearning.ai.  IDLE included.  
pandas-datareader installed for VanderPlas book.

Location, python packages in ubuntu.

\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\jyoon\conda3\lib\python3.7\site-packages

VanderPlas moved to \\wsl$\Ubunut\home\jyoon\w_van\
Original copy in cpythowork was deleted.
**learn-mldl** repo only has a few of my own notebooks, not all files from source.

#### WIP 8/25/2019  
 * Firefox browser on Ubuntu -- works now. VcXsrv added to .bashrc 
    * Jupyter notebook auto-opens firefox browser with session, but seems fuzzy resolution.
 * tensorflow CPU version installed, not beta, stable version.
    * tensorflow-datasets installed now!  Need to learn how to use it with API.
 * fastai v1.0 -- copied to conda3, but does not work.
     * need to reinstall, use fastai commands, to conda3 on Ubuntu.
     * Still working on it.  Just getting version 1.0 to work is OK.
     
 * Deleted conda3linux on c:\python.  Saved 10 GB disk space.     
   --------- 
 * Can use ROKU-TV as wireless 3rd monitor -- but resolution is too low.
 * Switched to Apple keyboard bluetooth.  Replaced batteries.  
   Control-key is 2nd left, need to adjust to it.  Keep making mistakes
   Ubuntu -- Control+Shift C/V. 
   Alt+Tab works, but ALT is 3rd from left-bottom corner.
   Overall, Apple bluetooth keyboard feels good for typing, better than Logitech, 
   which was feeling creaky/inaccurate.
    * How to show desktop using Apple keyboard?  Is 3 finger swipe on Asus touchpad.
