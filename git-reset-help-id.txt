# Git hard reset to merge commit histories.
# Too many small commits in a day, tried to combine several commits into one in history.  
# Commit graph rescale so that only one day was darkest green with 51 commits.  
# Commands were successful in Ubuntu bash, but did nothing to commit history numbers on Github.
# Is there a delay maybe?  Check again based on parent commit id above.  9/10/2019.

git reset --hard <old-commit-id>
git push -f <remote-name> <branch-name>
