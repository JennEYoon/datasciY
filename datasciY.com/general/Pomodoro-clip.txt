# general - life during pandemic, time managEment  

Time seems to flow into each hour without natural outlines.  There is no set time to gO to work or stop working and gO home oReat dinner.  
Setting boundaries of 25 minute work and 5 minute pauses, allow us to create individual blocks.  Treat each half hour with dignity and consiousness.  

"The Pomodoro technique showed me how much of my experience of reality is tied up with my subjective perception of it. And it’s not an exaggeration to say that, by changing my relationship with and appreciation of time, the technique has brought me to some profound existential questions about whether I’m wasting my life — my fragile, fleeting life — on activities I neither care about nor enjoy. It has forced me to think about what I’d most like to be doing every day instead. It has made me see time afresh — as something we really don’t have enough of, as something precious precisely because it’s ephemeral. "
