        <p>I attended the PyData NY 2019 Conference this week.  It was a wonderful 
        learning opportunity.  I especially enjoyed the tutorials.  
        I will write a longer article about it later.  </p>
        
        <p>The tutorials of note were:
        <ol>
            <li>Interview prep talk, Hacking a data science challenge by Michoel Snow (<a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2019/schedule/presentation/9/hacking-the-data-science-challenge/">Abstract 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michoelsnow/pydata_nyc_2019"> Github 1</a>), </li>
            
            <li>Unit testing talk, From Raw Recruit Scripts to Perfect 
            Python in 90 minutes, by Stanley van der Merwe and Petr Wolf (<a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2019/schedule/presentation/14/from-raw-recruit-scripts-to-perfect-python-in-90-minutes/">Abstract 2,</a> <a href="https://github.com/PetrWolf/pydata_nyc_2019/blob/master/tutorial.pdf">tutorials-pdf,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PetrWolf/pydata_nyc_2019">Github 2</a>), and</li>

            <li>Visualizing the 2019 Measles Outbreak in NYC (<a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2019/schedule/presentation/33/visualizing-the-2019-measles-outbreak-in-nyc-with-python/">Abstract 3</a> and <a href="https://carlos-afonso.github.io/measles/">Github 3</a>).</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        
        <p>I also heard about a Bayesian approach to Statistical Inference that 
        sounded interesting.  There is a free YouTube class using R and Stan library. 
        (<a href="https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/tutorials">Stan Tutorials</a>)</p>

        <p>Bokeh and Matplotlib - NYC Measles Outbreak, 2019, presentation.  
        https://github.com/carlos-afonso/measles/blob/master/pydata-nyc-2019/notebooks/nyc-measles-cases-by-neighborhood-final.ipynb  
        Only issue with Bokeh, background image of NYC map will now show up in svg image format.  All images were save to both png and svg formats.  
        svg is perferable, scalable.  But on phones, png loads faster.  Also html pages were saved from all notebook.  Github does not always 
        render notebooks.  Github.io web server, can add repo as project, html pages auto-populated and served in browser.   </p> <p>Try reproducing the project on my own.  Use mainly Matplotlib.  Maybe Plotly as well as Bokeh. </p>

    <h4>Advances in Financial Machine Learning book</h4>       
        <ul>

        <li>Link:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SWX7D6AOQ961&keywords=advances+in+financial+machine+learning&qid=1573432753&sprefix=advances+in+f%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1">Amazon book link</a></li>

        </ul>  
        <p>While I was at the NYC PyData Conference, I discussed a book for using 
        Machine Learning to make money in 2019. The book is called <b>Advances in Financial Machine Learning</b>, by Marcos Lopez de Prado, c 2018 from Wiley. 
        It is a very opinionated book.  And I don't agree with many of the author's views.  
        But it offers an interesting look inside the mind of a hedge fund manager trying to use Machine Learning to make money in 2018.  The author pans natural language processing to conduct sentiment analysis on earnings calls or satellite image processing to obtain product delivery or sales quantity estimates.  The author thinks the low hanging fruit from those methods are gone.  He believes in processing raw trading data from the exchanges to discover trading fingerprints of humans vs algo traders, as well as other classes of traders.  This can be used to create spread trading strategies where one class of traders can be expected to outperform another class of traders, under specific economic conditions. The Machine Learning part is used to automate raw data processing, where huge volumes are processed for the small nuggets of silver.</p>  
        <p>The code used in book examples seem to be Python, but without PEP8 styling. A group of people have tried to translate the author's code examples into fully finished coding exercises. See Github link above.</p>

        <p><b>Update on Long-Term Capital failure: </b> Originally in my chat with other attendees at PyData NY where I discussed this book, I was also explaining my take on the Long-Term Capital failure, and why I thought that they failed in an unusual way.  Since then, I already got 2 posts from people commenting on the Slack channel about my book post.  In brief, I read in an article that Fisher Black told someone close that the reason he decided not to join Long-Term Capital was because he thought their strategy boiled down to shorting liquidity.  I have no way to verify whether he said this.  However, after many years of thinking about it, I came to agree that LT Capital failed primarily because they were short liquidity.  This is unusual.  Most failures are primarily due to market risk or credit risk.  Although almost all failures do have a liquidity risk component, this is a short-term effect caused by deteriorating asset values.  In most failures, the main invested assets are later discovered to be fundamentally flawed and loses significant value.  This did not happen in the LT Capital failure.  The fund ran out of time, but the bulk of the positions were later sold at a profit.  I was working at the SEC when LT Capital failed and was involved in the wrap up.  I think we can only have an imperfect understanding of what happened then, even though this case has been extensively studied and reported on.</p>

        </ul>    
        <p>Woohoo! It's Octoberfest for Hackers again.  Register and submit 4 pull requests.  
        Get started on creating a habit of frequent Github commits.  The first 50,000
        participants to finish gets a free T-shirt from Digital Ocean.  Last year, I got reacquainted with Github through this Hactoberfest and a little help from NOVA Women Who Code. </p>

	    <p><b>Update: </b> I finished my four pull requests on October 25, 2019, and was able to get my Hactoberfest 2019 t-shirt from Digital Ocean. 
        This year about 60,000 people finished the challenge, and only the first 50,000 got t-shirts. So I was lucky to get one. </p>
        <p>I also submitted a pull-request to <b>geosnap</b>, which is a neighborhood economic analysis package.  I had more trouble with this repo because I am unfamiliar with the code base. See <a href="https://github.com/spatialucr/geosnap"> Github <b>geosnap</b> repo.</a></p>

    <h4>Understanding Convolutions - Otavio Good's talk on Word Lens</h4>    
        <ul>
        <li>Date:  August 19, 2019 </li>
        <li>Otavio Good's talk on <a href="https://youtu.be/Oqm9vsf_hvU?t=266">Word Lens</a> at O'Reilly AI conference, Sept. 2017</li>
        <li>Fast.ai 2018 Deep Learning Part 1 <a href="http://course18.fast.ai/lessons/lesson3.html">Lesson 3</a></li>
        </ul>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oqm9vsf_hvU?start=266" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>While studying deep learning with <strong>fast.ai</strong>, I came across a really good video that demonstrates a convolution in action.  In a convolution layer, a small grid crawls across the source image to produce an output image layer that is a combination of a source and a filter array.  Each small output area is a dot product of a small scanned input image area and the filter.  The filter (also called kernal) is most often a 3 x 3 array of numbers.  These frequently represent vertical, horizontal, or diagonal filters.  These filters themselves are products of previous machine learning steps.  Watch Otavio Good demonstrate how a convolutional layer recognizes the letter "<strong>A</strong>." </p>
            
        <p>Google acquired Word Lens app and the development team in May 2014. It's now part of Google Translate.  It can translate written signs and text (not hand writing) using your phone's camera in real-time.  It's really handy when travelling and trying to make sense of foreign language public signs on the street and at museums. ;-) </p>

    <!-- <h4>Convolutions continued</h4>
        LATER: Turn Convolution Demo into a longer article, include face image sobel filter demo.  
         - Sorbel Filter, 
         - MNIST scaled to 1 and 0 from uint8 - 3 blue 1 brown video.
        ### Visualizing sobel filter  
         A really cool way to visualize a (horizontal) sobel filter.      
        ![sorbel kernel image](sorbel_kernel_demo.png)  
        See website [Image Kernels by Victor Powell](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)  
        - Choose "top sobel" in the drop-down box to see the horizontal sorbel filter.  
        - A Sorbel filter increases weights on the center points.  
        For example, instead of the top line being (1, 1, 1) the middle weight is increased to (1, 2, 1).

    <h4>My Books in August 2019</h4>    
        <ul>
        <li>Date:  August 15, 2019 </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is the current state of my coding bookshelf.  On the top shelf there are financial coding, Python & R machine learning, coding interview, algorithms, and financial modeling books.  Bottom shelf has references for R and C++ coding, financial risk management, and statistics, probability, and stochastic calculus.  I like to study from several different books on the same topic.  I find that different authors have varying approaches, and they work best in combination.  Jake VanderPlas's <strong><em>Python Data Science Handbook</em></strong> (c 2017) is still my best book for learning Python data science libraries.  It's my go to book for Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook (for %magic and !shell commands).</p>

    <h4>Easy Explanation on How A Quantum Computer Works</h4>

        </ul>
        <p>This is an old video dated 2013, but has an easy to understand explanation on how a quantum computer works.  2^n is the number of information bits that can theoretically be combined.  2^300 is supposed to be a greater number than the number of [atoms] in the universe.  But this is only useful for calculations that can make use of the super-position state.  Also, for reading the final result, the quantum computer must drop back out of the super-position state into the normal state.  For normal calculations, the quantum computer is projected to be slower than a regular computer.</p>

    <h4>Beginning of Probability Measure Theory</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Date:  March 20, 2019 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I think one of the most confusing and difficult part of learning probability measure theory comes at the very beginning!  Obviously this project is going to be very opinionated.  :-)  DeMorgan's Laws and other rules for calculating probabilities, which comes after the beginning, are not that different from normal algebra.  I think most people can follow along and understand the other parts, if they do not make the mistake of getting forever stuck on the starting definitions!  We need to rename "probability space", "sigma-algebra", and all those greek letters, to something more English-like and easier to remember.  Anyway, I plan to post a very opinionated translation from Greek-Math-speak to Normal-English-speak. </p>

    <h4>GARP 20th Conference in NYC</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Date: February 24 - 27, 2019</li>
        </ul>	
		<p>I will be in NYC attending the 20th GARP Risk Conference.  The agenda has several sessions on machine learning and AI along with the usual risk topics.  I am interested in learning more about how data science and AI is being using by financial institutions.  I will also catch up with my former colleagues from the SEC while I am there.  Glad the scheduling worked out.</p>
	
	<h4>PyData DC 2018 and SciPy Austin 2018</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Date: November 20, 2018</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="">Attended the PyData DC 2018 conference in Tysons Corner, VA over the weekend.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Everybody was very nice and welcoming towards relatively new programmers, like myself.  I will post a write-up about several talks/software that caught my attention.  This conference was more accessible for me than SciPy in July 2018 at Austin, TX.  I come from a business background and have been learning Python and Data Science for only about 1.5 years.  Many of the people I talked to at PyData had similar backgrounds.  The SciPy community was more deeply into core python package development and were more advanced programmers.  The majority seemed to have PhDs in a hard science or math field.  For me personally, the learning experience was higher from the SciPy conference in a "tough love" way.  But I felt more of a sense of belonging and was happier at the PyData conference.  I will also have a writeup of a couple of the tools/talks I found most useful from the SciPy 2018 conference.</p>
