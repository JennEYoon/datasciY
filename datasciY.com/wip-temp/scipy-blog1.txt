More video playlist available, tutorials only have first 3 from Monday-Tuesday.  
I'm watching Numpy today.  Hopefully more will be added, later tutorials were excellent.

Note: For me, I need to get more comfortable with structured arrays in Numpy, dictionary like.  

Note: For me, MatPlotLib - read the documentation, get better at distinguishing Object Method and Subplot method.  3D does it need to be in Object Method only?  Seems like it does.  Answer more Stack Overflow questions on MatPlotLib after practicing.
