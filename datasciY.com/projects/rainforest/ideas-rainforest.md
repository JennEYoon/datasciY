## Date: June 16, 2021 start  

## Author: Jennifer E Yoon

## To Create a blog and wiki about the project.  

### Wiki will be on Github -- for people who will download whole repo and try to replicate.  
  * information on code organization and how to run the models.  
  * Informatio more condensed than Blog project page.  
  * Team mates - create project sheet to coordinate work. 

  * > https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml/wiki

### Blog will be on DatasciY.com  
 * TO showcase my work to future job recruiters  
 * To teach other newbies, every step explored, as a learning opportunity.  
 * Help my Meetup general members who are newbies, not team mates

## Team mates coordination  
  * Use Slack for 2-way communication. 
  * Can link to a project sheet on Wiki or page in general repo in Slack.
  * Can also link to specific pages in Blog, if referring to my written report.

### Section 0: Project Overview, Resources, Links 

Detailed Writeup of Project Domain.  Review of available literature, some code sxamples. 


### Section 1: Data Input  

 * Logging into Kaggle, agreeing to data user form, download to local computer.
 * Downloading file from Kaggle, write up with icon image.  Torrent not working due to lack of seeds. 
 * Kaggle API using to download data
 * Path object from pathlib.py -- write up with examples, for Google Colab, for local Ubuntu.  
 * Test input to fastai DataLoaders, DataBlock using cats sample images 
 * Discover files need 2 formats, large enough to form a batch.  
 * Test using PLANET_TINY form fastai s3 server.  
 * Test using 2000 images manually selected from Planet jpg downloads. 

### Section 2: Replication -- run a full deep learning model, get somewhere in 80%-90% accuracy.  

  * Create benchmark, non-deep learning method, simple ResNet34 deep learning method.  
  * Replicated on my own  
  * Read more blogs by top winning teams from 2017 Kaggle Challenge
