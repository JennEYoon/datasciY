#### March 7 Sunday, this week:  
 * battery bank testing, 1x phone 30%-100%.  
 * Seems to be damaged after being in Sunlight.  1st notch, 0th notch.  
 * Called Chris, talk again Wed midnight?  No, busy working straight through until Saturday. 
 * Making more cards.  Send as gifts Chris, Gale, Kevin w Cookies.  
 * Keiko - send cards.  
 * To Do - ***Fasting*** this week. No, try again 3/14 Sunday week.   
 * \-   
 * Meetup - Tuesday - Me to present chp 6, prepare slides, keep to 15 minutes, take questions.   
 * My presentation went well, but I presented for 50 minites, yikes!  
 * Next time, don't change the whole presentation for newbies. Maybe just what book we are studying and how to get on Colab.  
 * Dan did a good job with Chp 7, answering questions.  
   - Peter says I did a good job, just a little long.  Good!  
   - Practice more shortening it. I am a Work in Progress!    
 * \-\-\-    
 * March 10/2021 Wed:  
   - To purge repo, images, large files - geo-ml, deep-learning, learn-coding. 
   - goe-ml, first try rolling back 2 commit histories.  
   - Next try deleting edits without commit history?  
  * -\-\-  
  * March 12/2021 Friday:  
    - Past 2-3 days, on a roll programming, Pandas review, Plotly & Cufflinks. 
    - Udated resume, add Plotly, remove Tableau, add TensorFlow.  Changed header to Graphs & Vis.  
    - Working out Plotly, use VS Code?  
      - Ubuntu side does not display charts before running notebook.  
      - Fixed, "Trust notebook" security javascript stripped images.  
    - Use VS Code from Linux, bottom-left menu, seleted "Remote Server" for Linux conda env.  
    - Reinstalled basic Python to Windows C:/python/ folder.  No other library.  VS Code opens it by default.  
    - Good, keep bare Python v3.9 on Windows C drive. Only 2 envs on Ubuntu, fastai20 for all deep learning, base for basic ML.  
    - to do - Upload coding files to Google Drive from SD card.  Maybe delete some, so don't upload all.  

#### Installing a package from inside Jupyter notebook shell:  
Pass --yes or -y flag at end, !pip or !conda also works!  

    >You can launch shell commands with the ! operator in ipython, but you can't interact with them after the process has launched. 
     Therefore, you could: execute your conda command outside of your ipython session (IOW, a normal shell); or  
     pass the --yes flag. e.g.: 
     ``` 
    !conda create -n graphlab-env python=2.7 anaconda -y
    >```
    > - How to install a library from Jupyter notebook cell? %%bash converts commands into terminal, but how to respond to "Y/N" install querry?  
    - --yes or -y tag added to end. Solved!  

#### March 14, 2021 Sunday:  

Need to take a break from coding to take care of person stuff that needs attention.  
car - charge again.  
cards -- send out this week  
exercise -- start daily ritual  
laundry, cleaning  
Check on tax refund 2017 - wait 1 more week.  
Register VA - 10 Sigma Risk  
\-\-\-  

 * Amazon Rainforest -- did more research on the problem space, 2019 was extremely bad year due to Bolonaro's policy change. 2020 was almost as bad, even with officially policy stopped. Posted linked to Slack DSMLtalk group.  
 * Start working with JPG files, get it into Google Colab instance, or GPU instance.  
 * Write up small projects for posting on my website.  
 * WCC - TF2, finish sample project.  Do Pre-process with Pandas, 4-layer DL model.  
 * SEC-private repo, 44 commits, ready to merge with jennifer-yoon private repo, with or without histories.  
 * fastai-app repo -- keep.  For software study, fastai v2.  Also keep a few hosted notebook apps.  

#### 3/16 Tuesday:  
 * Feel sick today, take a break from coding.  
 * javascript - Travesty, continuing, 90 min total.  
 * Sent message to WCC -- will be out this week, can't attend getting busy with Meetup.   
 * VA Corporation, registered 10 Sigma Risk LLC
 * Pandas practice, did 3 days, ready to finish TF2 project Udemy class.  
 * Interesting talk, How not to give a "f*ck" book guy.  
 * Regrets from Self-Taught programmer guy -- not really stuff he could have skipped over.  
   - He wish he had gone to a good CS college for degree, but he could only get into a community college, so not something he could have done differently  
   - He wish he didn't copy SO answers and wash his hands of the problem afterwards, yeah that's being lazy and not trying to understand why the code worked.  Sometimes you can't understand because your level of understanding is not up there yet, but not even making an effort is just being lazy.  So not something you can regret, other than say don't be so lazy next time.  
   - He regrets working part-time for $12/hr for 1.5 years before getting a fully-time better paying job, but he probably could not have gotten anything better at the time, and staying at one place for 1.5 years at part-time was probably the only way he could have accumulated the experience, so not something he could regret either.  
   - Yeah, these are bad aspect of his learning, but much better than going to school for 4 years and $100,000 in debt, even is he could have gotten into a good CS school, which he couldn't at all, so wishing he could get the success he achieved, without any of the pain points, is really not understanding the value of hard work and sacrifice. 
 
#### Mar 18, 2021 TH:  
 * Recovered body, sleep well 3 days to Friday.  
 * Prepped card kit for Chris, also to send card & present to Gale.

#### Mar 19, 2021 Friday: 
 * Weekend -  Start fastai small group, chp 11.   
 * Rainforest - load data to Google Colab, fastai chp 6, multiclass dl model.  
 * \-  
 * Personal:  
   - Start tax 2020 
   - Jenny walk, champaign.  
   - garden prune, bulbs, pansy, grass cut  
 * heartburn again, too much carbs?  or too much letteuce?  Saturday 9 am.
