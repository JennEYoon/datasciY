  * March 12/2021 Friday:  
    - Past 2-3 days, on a roll programming, Pandas review, Plotly & Cufflinks. 
    - Udated resume, add Plotly, remove Tableau, add TensorFlow.  Changed header to Graphs & Vis.  
    - Working out Plotly, use VS Code?  Ubuntu side does not display charts before running notebook. Fixed, "Trust notebook" security javascript stripped.  
    - Use VS Code from Linux, bottom-left menu, seleted "Remote Server" for Linux conda env.  
    - Reinstalled basic Python to Windows C:/python/ folder.  No other library.  VS Code opens it by default.  
    - Good, keep bar Python v3.9 on Windows C drive. Only 2 envs on Ubuntu, fastai20 to all deep learning, base for basic ML.  
    - Upload coding files to Google Drive from SD card.  Maybe delete some, so don't upload all.
