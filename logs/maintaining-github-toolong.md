# Maintaining Github takes too long.  

DON"T keep tasks, only short logs of items done, short memory joggers if desires, don't worry about typos!  
* Consolidate repos as much as possible.  
* Merge with histories again, delete old repos.  
* Also, not everything needs to be on Github or have a local repo, only stuff I want to have version control.
