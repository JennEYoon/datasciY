   * udemy Tensorflow 2 - Jose Portilla  
   * udacity - free Pytorch intro, Meetup    
 
### 5) Coursera.org DLAI - to finish this year - no longer plan.  
  > Coursera classes went behing paywall as of Sept 2020 end.  Cannot access any notebooks or quizzes for Meetup.  
  > Shift focus to Fast.AI 2020 classes instead.  
  > Can to ahead and download Class 5 Sequence Models, and review on my own sometime, but no longer main focus.

### 6) Fluent Python book, Python Workouts book  
  * June started, good for understanding structures.  
  * Don't need to read most of it, just focus on areas I want, more core-basic stuff.  
  * Python Workout book - short exercises, doing chapter 5 file I/O 
    - reading csv, excel, json files?    

### 7) Other Books Reading - June-July 2020:  

  * Good Habits Bad Habits - help to change sleep time, exercise & fasting, meditation & eye exercise  
  * Capital in 21 Century - ideas on inequality economics projects using DS.  
  * Head First Javascript (c 2014). - to add simple .js to my website.  
   \-   
 * New Good Habit - set up environment as much as possible to provide cues for action.  
   Make it as repeatable as possible, simple cue, then default action.  No delay to think about it.  
   - I've successfully set up Good Habit of hugging/greeting Bill as soon as he comes home from work.   
   - I've successfully set up Good Habit of contributing 1 items to GitHub, as soon as I wake up.   
     1-year success along with how to fix it when I forget, 3-4 times.  
   - Successfully established habit of prgramming practice almost daily from July 2018 SciPy conference to now, with 2 breaks. 
   
   ***Next Habit: Daily exercise & Sleep at same time daily.***

## Goals Met as of June 2020:  

#### Tools & Envs:  
  * Bash-Ubuntu: 
    - I am reasonably comfortable now with bash directory commands. 
    - Alias, adding scripts to .bashrc. startt file
    - using nano and cat with text files
  * miniconda and pip installers:  
    - I am comfortable now working with conda envs, creating, exporting, installing pkgs, pip, updating, activating.  Use of env.yml file to build env image.  Hosting on GitHub, MyBinder, CoLab using env.yml file.   
  * Git and GitHub:  
    - Finally somewhat comfortable with rebase, reset HEAD, edit history, remote force push, git clone, git add remote, and git merge feature branch. 
  * Got working hosted Jupyter notebooks/Hub via Google CoLab and MyBinder.org  
  * GitHub commit graph -- 7/3/2020 Update:  
    - July 19, 2020, will reach 1-year history  
    - Get solid filled 1-year history, 16 days to go.  
      (Originally was to get 4 weeks of continuous history, then continued on)   
    - Over 3648 commits in past year. 
  * SO got over 500 pts in 2019.  
    - To get another 500 points in 2020.  
    - Got bonus 109 pts, from people voting up my earlier answers. 
    - To get back to it this Fall, reach 1000 pts by Nov 2020. 
  * Markdown formatting -- finally feel comfortable with text formatting, bullets, bold, code tick marks, quote block.  Also insert html link, image link with sizing HTML codes, image link wihtout sizing markdown.  
  * VS Code editor -- how to select python engine, format code, indent, tab/html edit, run on selected python terminal, run on ipython interface, view markdown, view jupyter notebook, export as jupyter notebook, etc.  
  * Jupyter Notebook -- how to use, markdown edit, select cells, run connected python module, refresh imported module  
  * Python package management, installing, importing, updating, reload, run, %run automatically re-run, Ubuntu and Win versions  
  * Basic webdev, html, css, frameworks, css grid, hosting on Amazon, email redirect for jyoon@10sigmarisk.com  - 2017 first half year.  
  * Read Javascript the Good Parts, started practice with Head First Javascript.  

#### Python & ML:  
  * Finally seem to have a firm fix on class obj.  
    - what is class-wide constant
    - what is initialized with each instance, private constants, variabes
    - WHen to use () to call function, create class object.  
    - Format for passing variables to class instance, updating class instance variable. 
    - Inherit from base class to sub class.  Use () in class creation.  
    - Call class() to create instance of class object.  
  * 8/9 Sunday - file open(), text and binary read, seek() to move index, read(), readline() single, readlines(), readlines()[-1], relative seek for binary read only.  Got much more comportable with file I/O past week. Python Workout cht 5 and extensions from online.
  * Reasonably good with Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot 
    - could use more recent practice  
  * Familiar with Pandas
  * Started on sk-learn 
  * Started on tensorflow v 2. 
  * Reasonably good understanding of Machine Learning, before deep-learning.  
  * Medium level on Deep-Learning, Coursera.org halfway.  
  * Started learning about Python-MySQL-Connector, already know SQL language.  
  * Got SO practice on usign Excel with Python, manipulating objects from python module.  
    - Even 1 for no points was good refresher on if-else : usage and def func(): . Had forgot syntax.
