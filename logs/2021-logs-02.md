 > conda list -n myenv  
 > !conda list -n myenv (from Jupyter NB)   
 List all packages installed in named conda env.  

```
==> WARNING: A newer version of conda exists. <==
  current version: 4.7.11
  latest version: 4.9.2 
```
  
> conda update -n base -c defaults conda    
Updates conda base env.  

"cpuonly" -- is a pytorch library for CPU  

First install into conda env, then inside notebook, set default device to torch.device('cpu')  

Installation:  
(1) Install PyToch CPU version into fastai20 env  (env name is "fastai20")
    Source channel is set to pytorch. (Not anaconda but pytorch directly)
    conda activate fastai20  
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch 
(2) Install fastbook afterwards  (May be to change default device to "cpu" also)
    conda activate fastai20  (named conda env)
    "pip install fastbook"  
    
(2error) /home/jyoon/conda3/envs/fastai20/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:52:user warning: 
         CUDA initialization: Found no NVIDIA driver  
         See if installing "cpuonly" library fixed this error.  
         
Updating conda error:  
Downloads everything, then Verification fails. 

RemoveError: 'setuptools' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from
conda's operating environment.  

conda update --force conda  
worked! No, still older version of conda.  

Installing Jupyter Lab seems to have fixed the problem.  
         
#### Run on CPU, Learned model from GPU:  

Works!  Training takes 1.5 hr on CPU vs 1 minute on GPU fastbook.  
Chp5 -- stopped before, Imrpovign Our Model
Feb 9, 2021 Tu, 2:50 AM stopped nb5 on ubuntu.

#### Th Feb 11 updte log:  

To add yesterday's commit 

* WCC went well, next week back prop math, 
  * todo --  Me to post images of layers, components for NN.  
  SGD MA graphic, avoid local minima.  
  \-\-\-  
* Friday call w Dan, Peter - projects.  
  Amazon Rainforest proposal.  
  \-\-\-  
* Tuesday 16th - call w Holden, geosnap.  
* 22nd Monday samll group - chp10 NLP Deep Dive, changed.    
* March meetup cpt 6,7 fastai.  

#### Friday Feb 12:  
Talk with Dan Peter went well.  
Start working on my first end to end deep learning project.  
 * Amazon rainforest data.  
 * message Holden, David about chp 10 instead of chp 12 small group, 2 weeks. - done. 
\-\-\-  
Youtube -- Fastai 8 videos up for 2020-part 1.  
Go through rapidly.  
***May 2021 Goal: Me finish to chp 15. (last 3 chps from scratch)***  

#### Sun Feb 14, 2021:  
  * Working on Geosnap, next 2 days.  
  * Tu, W - WCC backprop, post images of NN layers, mini-batch.  
  * F - Sunday, Meetup Project, reproduce fastai v3 guy, using Chp5 Resnet34.  
  * Next week -- Chp 10 NLP Deep Dive.  
  * Next week -- WCC PyTorch tutorials.  

#### Feb 16, 2021 Tuesday:  
  * Holden meeting canceled, he's stuck in Texas without power or internet!  
  * Load geosnap, try tutorial for Maryland FIPS code.  
  * Wed & Th - WCC backprop math

#### Feb 19 Friday:  
Freezing weather, Saturday night severe freeze.  
Code backprop myself to remember.  
Finish fastai in 2-3 months, April - May 2021.  
Pytorch udemy - basic.  
Git more rebase practice, understanding.  

#### Feb 20 Saturday:  
 * To move pot inside, 18 degrees night.  
 * Bulbs pot, pansies repot  
 * 10 Sigma Risk LLC - Virginia register.  
 * \-\-\-

 * Backprop math, code from scratch, Youtube {\, /} example, 3Blue1Brown refs.  
 * Feb 19 -- moved out Coursera-DLAI to separate repo.  Reduce space on Deep-Learning repo. Large movie files moved to local C drive.  

#### Feb 20 Saturday - night:  
 * Reading Goodfellow - Deep Learning book, 
   - Monte Carlo methods, chapter 17, page 590.  
     > Sampling and Monte Carlo Methods:  
     > "Many important technologies used to accomplish machine learning goals are based on drawing samples from some probability distribution 
     > and using these sampes to ***form a Monte Carlo estimate*** of some desired quantity."
   - Review chapters 4 Numberical Computation, 5 Machine Learning Basics seems good:  
     - 4.3) Gradient-Based Optimization 
     - 5.9) Stochastic Gradient Descent 
     - 5.10) Building Machine Learning Algorithms 
     - 5.6) Bayesian Statistics  
   - Refresh Linear Algebra chp 2:  
     - 2.8) SVD 
     - 2.9) Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse 
     - 2.12) PCA  

 * Review Vanderplas book:  
   - Scikit-Learn, chp5: Scattered examples, look at documentation for more structure.  
   - Pandas chapter review  
 
 * Look through McKinney's Pandas book.  
   (Where is my PDF electronic version?  O'Reilly download.)  

### Feb 22, Monday:  
 * Big fluffy snow started 8am this morning. :-)  
 *   stopped 9am  
 * Finished fastai chp 10 yesterday.  Github missed, update later.  
 * Youtube lesson 8 is for chp 10 - started  
 * Udemy PyTorch NLP is for tokenization, character.  
 * Fastai - write my own tokenizer for character - using numpy.  
 * Youtube - Python Expert video - list.  



------------------------------------------------     
 
## Longer-Term Goals: 

  * Do more interview class Q&A  
  * Algorithms, SQL Postgres, Tableau, Plotly.  
  * Review Stats general, Read Bayesian stats, review ML basics.  
  * Fluent Python more chapters, Vanderplas finish, Fastai book finish,  
  * skim Hands-on book, skim Keras DL book.  
  * Build out projects, do group project Amazon Rainforest.  
  * Work on my body, health, eye sights, weight, sleep time.  
  * Daily schedule - work more from 1st floor office.  
    Dust all areas. Organize stuff.  
  * Daily walks starting March.  
  * Garden starting March.  
  * Clean house inside, organize LR 2nd fl, 1st fl - 2021.
