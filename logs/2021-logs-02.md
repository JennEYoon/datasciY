# WIP logs Feb 2021  

#### Feb 3, 2021 12:00 AM:  
 * Working on fastai this week, chp 5, file system.  
 * WCC Th, next week NLP Udemy - started on.  
 * Next week Holden - geosnap example -- takes longer.  
 
#### Feb 4 Th:  
More work on fastai chp5  
Video 4 last half, 1/3 of video 6.  
  path = (Images/'dogbreed_01.jog')
  Path.Base_Xxx() = path

Noon TH, WCC - NPL, do later myself.  
WCC TF lectures 1 next week, TF2 Keras 2 weeks later, Pytorch 3 weeks. 
  
#### Feb 5 F:  
Fastai more documents review.  
Found help docs for fastai, similar to course notebooks.  
Car charge 1h, get gas, Korean food, water lg. 

#### Feb 6 Sat early morning:  
Review Javascript 9H, Caleb tutorial  
Fun, continue on weekends, when not working on my main items.  

#### Feb 7, 2021 Sunday, Superbowl LV:  

 * Tom Brady wins another SUPERBOWL!  
 * Working on fastai chp5, DataLoader, DataBlock fastai package.  
 
 
 #### Feb 8, 2021 Monday:  
 working on fastai chp5 today.

 > conda list -n myenv  
 > !conda list -n myenv (from Jupyter NB)   
 List all packages installed in named conda env.  

```
==> WARNING: A newer version of conda exists. <==
  current version: 4.7.11
  latest version: 4.9.2 
```
  
> conda update -n base -c defaults conda    
Updates conda base env.  

"cpuonly" -- is a pytorch library for CPU  

First install into conda env, then inside notebook, set default device to torch.device('cpu')  

Installation:  
(1) Install PyToch CPU version into fastai20 env  (env name is "fastai20")
    Source channel is set to pytorch. (Not anaconda but pytorch directly)
    conda activate fastai20  
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch 
(2) Install fastbook afterwards  (May be to change default device to "cpu" also)
    conda activate fastai20  (named conda env)
    "pip install fastbook"  
    
(2error) /home/jyoon/conda3/envs/fastai20/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:52:user warning: 
         CUDA initialization: Found no NVIDIA driver  
         See if installing "cpuonly" library fixed this error.  
         
Updating conda error:  
Downloads everything, then Verification fails. 

RemoveError: 'setuptools' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from
conda's operating environment.  

conda update --force conda  
worked! No, still older version of conda.  

Installing Jupyter Lab seems to have fixed the problem.  
         
#### Run on CPU, Learned model from GPU:  

Works!  Training takes 1.5 hr on CPU vs 1 minute on GPU fastbook.  
Chp5 -- stopped before, Imrpovign Our Model
Feb 9, 2021 Tu, 2:50 AM stopped nb5 on ubuntu.

#### Th Feb 11 updte log:  

To add yesterday's commit 

* WCC went well, next week back prop math, 
  Me to post images of layers, components for NN.  
  SGD MA graphic, avoid local minima.  
  
* Friday call w Dan, Peter - projects.  
  Amazon deforestation proposal.  
  Read over Dan's proect some more.  
* Tuesday 16th - call w Holden, geosnap.  
* 22nd Monday samll group - chp12 NLP  

* March meetup cpt 6,7 fastai.  

Missed another commit day.  
Talk with Dan Peter went well.  
Sraert woking on my first end to end deep learning project.
