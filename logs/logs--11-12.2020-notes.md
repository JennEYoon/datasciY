# Working notes - Nov & Dec 2020  

***Reminder: Slack, post message for next meetup, on Meetup post schedule.***    

## Work Logs: 

#### 10/29/2020 Thursday Notes    

  * Merge repos, learn-mldl into deep-learning, with histories intact.  - no, repurposed instead.  
    - Keep Coursera DLAI folder, for reference.  
  * DSML send out emails to 4 presenters.  done.  

#### Dec 1, 2020  
  * Next Meetup, send emails to newbie presenters, post on Slack and Meetup.com messages.  
  * Me chapter 4 start - prep  
  * Me - Chp 13 CNN prep - small group.  
  * Voila production app - export models first after training.  

#### Dec 7, 2020 Monday:  
  * Small Group today.  
  * re-reading chapter 13.  stopped at p 412, before Our First CNN p. 414.  
  
  > F.conv2d()  
  > F is fastai import from PyTorch, F is class?  
  > PyTorch **torch.nn.functional** spec: 
  > input: input tensor of shape(minibatch, in_channels, iH, iW), iH is image rows 
  > weight: filters of shape (out_channels, in_channels, kH, kW), kH is kernel rows

#### Dec 8, 2020 Meetup notes:  
  * 3 presenters Jan 2020  
    Holden - volunteered again, talk about anything  
    Peter - 2nd half of notebook 4  
    Deborah - moderate Q&A for notebooks 1-3/4.  
  * We agreed to try to do a project together as a group in 2021.  
    Maybe Kaggle?  I can provide support.  

#### Dec 13, 2020 practice  
  * Do some Vanderplas Matplotlib and Numpy practice   
    - np.linspace(start, stop, numsteps)  linear space, geomspace, logspace also available.  
    - np.arange(start, stop, stepsize)  
    **OOP**
    fig, ax = subplots(1, 2)  # numrow, numcol  
    ax[0].plot(x, y, 'color')
    ax[1].plot(x, y, 'color')  
    **MATLAB**  
    plt.figure()  # create figure 
    plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
    plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))
    * subplots MATLAB 
    plt.figure()
    plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)  # row, col, panel 1
    plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
    plt.subplot((2, 1, 2)  # row, col, panel 2 
    plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))
    
#### Dec 15 notes  
   * Do Vanderplas Pandas fully, including database, steipping PDF tables data.  
   * More practice with Matplotlib.  
   * Memorize Sklearn models.  
   * Wcc - practice doing notebooks without looking at code solution.  
   
   Reminder: Slack, post message for next meetup, on Meetup post schedule.  

#### Dec 20, 2020 notes:  
  * Workingon fastai this week.  
  * Watched some Lex interviews last 2 days.  
  * Read book first, then look at notebook for code.  
    - Watch videos later, too long, too rambling.  
    
#### Dec 22 Tuesday  
  * Slack comments, WCC, DSML  
  * Plan on github, datasciy/log folder  
  * DEC 23 - 11h work greenhouse, sides do not zip, modify base width 3h wasted.  

####  Dec 24, 2020 notes:  
  * fastbook seems more high level.  To get under the hood, need to work on addition projects from end of chapter.   
    Read through all fast, 2 months, then try some end of chapter research suggestions.  
  * Coursera may be better for some under-the-hood discussion, if not code.  
    To finish class 5 in Q1 2021.  On my own, sign up using different email.  
    When ready re-login with jenneyoon@ or mail@ and finish. Get certificate.  

### Dec 26 notes:  
  * Meetup posted Jan schedule  
  * Small group Jan 25 M 6:30 pm, chp 14 fastai ResNets.  
  * MEETUP MAIN - Read 2nd half notebook 4, 5.  
  * Holden replied Dec 15, meet week of Jan 12, Th-F proposed.  
    General talk, learning new pkg, contributing to Github pkg dev.  

### DEC 29 Tu  
  * 2h fluentpy w colab, ipad air old.  
    works ok for simple exercise.  
  * numpy matrix multiply, add, use @ infix opeator.  
  * standard library array modules does not understand element wise operation.  
    + and * appends to numerical list only. @ operator not recognized.  
  * numpy upcasts type, so if numerical list is added or multiplied, result is a numpy array.
