# Learning how to learn coding, do personal projects  

Fastai first 2 chapters has lots of tips on how to learn data science, how to work on personal projects.  

Take notes, review frequently.  
Also review other sources of "how to learn".  

#### Youtube Ex-Googler:  
Work through all of tutorials and documentation by core developer. Don't skip any parts. Has laid out all of the areas that core deveopers thought were important about the library.   

#### Data Science Weekly:  
Work on 1 small reproducible part of an existing project or paper at a time, about 2 hours to complete.  Look at existing code and replicate it on a blank Jupyter notebook.  Type a few cells of code at a time without looking at the solutions.  

Work on projects that are in industries using tools and keywords mentioned from my job descriptions keywords search step.  

First end-to-end project should be a reproduction of a simple project in my industry.  Then extend using other tools, idea, data, visualizations, etc.  

After 2-3 reproduction projects, then work on my own project from scratch, but still using common methods already in existance.  Using my own data in a slightly novel way.
