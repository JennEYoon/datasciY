#### How to show jupyter notebooks on website?  

  1. HTML static viewer for non-coders, HR people. -- registered with NBViewer, Jupyter hub.  
     https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/  
      * Also create collapsing headings - for subprojects.  
    
  2. Executable, Open in Colab link, directly on Webpage - projects.  
  
  3. Executable, Run in MyBinder link, directly on Webpage and from Github.  
    
  4. Dedocated Github repo - "notebooks-hosted" for special projects, more than one notebook. 
     - https://github.com/JennEYoon/notebooks-hosted  
     - With MyBinder and CoLab option  
     - With related files in same repo  
     - Large files - Google Drive shareable link, or Original Source URL   
    
  5. Data for running Projects:    
     * Download individual files from datasciY.com on AWS, 
       small files only <15 MB, otherwise transfer out fees apply.  
       http://datasciY.com/projects/name/data.*
  
     * Large data files, download from Google Drive with shareable link.  
       C:\Users\jyoon\gdrive\Colab Notebooks\data-large\    
       Or provide original data source URL.  

     * Public data file link: can use datasciY, already have public URL.  
       Or AWS S3 public bucket, just for data - pay for transfer out fee - OK for small files.  
   
     * Shareable public link from Google Drive, faster to read from Colab (Google), OK seems good.  
       Find a way to read text files into CoLab from shareable link on Google Drive (public).  
       Can I mount a folder, use for all data files?  Yes.  from drive mount...
