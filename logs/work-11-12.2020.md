***Reminder: Slack, post message for next meetup, on Meetup post schedule.***    

## Work Logs: 

#### 10/29/2020 Thursday Notes    

  * Merge repos, learn-mldl into deep-learning, with histories intact.  - no, repurposed instead.  
    - Keep Coursera DLAI folder, for reference.  
  * DSML send out emails to 4 presenters.  done.  

#### Dec 1, 2020  
  * Next Meetup, send emails to newbie presenters, post on Slack and Meetup.com messages.  
  * Me chapter 4 start - prep  
  * Me - Chp 13 CNN prep - small group.  
  * Started fastai nbs 1 and 2 this past week.  
  * Started Voila production app.  

#### Dec 7, 2020 Monday:  
  * Small Group today.  
  * re-reading chapter 13.  stopped at p 412, before Our First CNN p. 414.  
  
  > F.conv2d()  
  > F is fastai import from PyTorch, F is class?  
  > PyTorch **torch.nn.functional** spec: 
  > input: input tensor of shape(minibatch, in_channels, iH, iW), iH is image rows 
  > weight: filters of shape (out_channels, in_channels, kH, kW), kH is kernel rows

#### Dec 8, 2020 Meetup notes:  
  * 3 presenters Jan 2020  
    Holden - volunteered again, talk about anything  
    Peter - 2nd half of notebook 4  
    Deborah - moderate Q&A for notebooks 1-3/4.  
  * We agreed to try to do a project together as a group in 2021.  
    Maybe Kaggle?  I can provide support.  

#### Dec 13, 2020 practice  
  * Do some Vanderplas Matplotlib and Numpy practice   
    - np.linspace(start, stop, numsteps)  linear space, geomspace, logspace also available.  
    - np.arange(start, stop, stepsize)  
    **OOP**
    fig, ax = subplots(1, 2)  # numrow, numcol  
    ax[0].plot(x, y, 'color')
    ax[1].plot(x, y, 'color')  
    **MATLAB**  
    plt.figure()  # create figure 
    plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
    plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))
    * subplots MATLAB 
    plt.figure()
    plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)  # row, col, panel 1
    plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
    plt.subplot((2, 1, 2)  # row, col, panel 2 
    plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))
    
#### Dec 15 notes  
   * Do Vanderplas Pandas fully, including database, steipping PDF tables data.  
   * More practice with Matplotlib.  
   * Memorize Sklearn models.  
   * Wcc - practice doing notebooks without looking at code solution.

## Plan going forward:  

 1) Fastai book and Class - finish rapidly, all in 5 months (Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, March) 
 1b) Suppliment with Chollet book, Deep Learning with Python 
 1c) Vanderplas - Do Scikit-Learn chapter, Pandas chapter.  
 1d) Fluent Python book, do more to get better. Do testing.  
 1e) Algorithms book, review common algorithms.  
 1f) Coursera DeepLearning.AI - review notebooks and tools, see if there is something I can re-use.  
     - Get certificate in Nov/Dec?  Finish class 5 first. 
 1g) Tutorials from SciPy, Videos recent AI talks.  
 
 2) More projects on datasciY.com  
    - Matplotlib OO vs Matlab style  
    - FastAPI  
    - Geospatial viz, econ data  
 
 3) Interview Prep - various Q&As, Jose Portilla class  
 3b) Build a Career book  
 
 4) Review SQL, use it to help me get a job. 
    - PostgresSQL, one may be enough.  
    - Python SQL connector.  
    - SQL Pocket reference, practice commands.  
 
 5) Review Finance and Risk Management, Probability & Statistics    
    - get current regulations, current events.  
    - Do some Python exercises pricing models, trading models.  
    - Lookup websites GARP, SEC, FINRA, Fed, CFTC.  
  
 6) Kaggle, HackerRank -- see if I can do a challenge from start to finish  
    - Meetup DSML group Kaggle?  
 6b) Stack Overflow - get 1000 pts by Dec 2020, get 2000 pts by August 2021.
