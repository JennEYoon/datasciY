#### Bill finished standing desk, me setup white work desk -- done 9/29/2020.  
  * Moved my white credenza up, set-up white desk
  * Attached 1 smaller monitor, but too noisy to work there during the day when Bill is on call or has TV on.
    (Even downstairs is too loud to concentrate when he's on call, use ear plugs - good)
  * Bill talks to me constantly and interrupts my train on thought!  
  * Good for alternative place to read or relax and work on crafting, when I don't need to concentrate.  
  * Good for late at night, after Bill goes to bed.  
  
#### Keep downstairs desk setup for myself:  
  * Need a separate floor to get any work done!  Bill too much interruptions.  
  * Air quality OK after hosing off outside - do regularly in Summer months.  
  * Wear neck covering, jacket to keep warm.  
  * Turn on fan often, dust all books soon -- to do.  
  * Later -- Create sheer curtain covering over bookshelves, wash every 3-6 months.  
  
#### 9/28 6 am, finished setting up my white desk on 2nd floor.  
  * Keep using downstairs as my main work area.  Too much interruptions from Bill to use here.
