## Udemy.com -- Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp   

### Author: Jennifer E Yoon in Leesburg, Virginia   

#### Active Learning Period: 2019 March - July  

### My practice exercises  

I really enjoyed this class.  If you do most of the exercises from scratch in a new Jupyter notebook, instead of only watching the vieos, you will become a competent user of basic data science libraries (Jupyter notebook, iPython shell, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn).  One of my friends found this class to be unfulfilling because it does not examine much math or the logic of  algorithms used in the libraries.  I like it just fine for quickly learning the most useful Python library commands for doing Machine Learning.  It's a simpler (and shorter) version of Jake VanderPlas's ***Python Data Science Handbook***.

#### Additional Resources for Machine Learning    

This Udemy class' Machine Learning section is especially brief.  It only gives brief glimpses of the main machine learning models.  You would need to go onto another book or class to become good enough to run the models yourself in a useful way.  It does cover all of the top models, so you can use it as a starting point for learning more about machine learning models.  

Jake VanderPlas' excellent book has about 200 pages on machine learning.  So it goes deeper into machine learning than this Udemy class.  But even that book leaves something to be desired.  I recommend studying ***Introduction to Statisical Learning with R***, ***Elements of Statistical Learning***, ***Handson Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, 2nd ed.***, ***Python Deep Learning, 2nd ed.***, or ***Deep Learning book***.  All of these books have exercises freely available online.  Some of them also have YouTube videos provided by authors.  

 * Jake Vanderplas book is a good companion to this Udemy class.

 * ISLR is an easy introduction to the entire field of machine learning.  It uses R instead of Python.

 * ESL is an important historical book that covers the math and concept of machine learning.

 * Hands-on Machine Learning may be one of the best Python version of the ISLR book.
