# Host notebooks via Google CoLab.  

Barely usable on iPad Pro.  OK for running short python scripts.  
Better suited to edit existing notebook than starting a new notebook.  

  * Q) How to activate shortcut commands?  
  * Q) How to copy cell tex/code and paste on next cell?  
       I have to retype now.  Can't select text block.
