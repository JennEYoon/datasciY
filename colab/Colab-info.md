### Code for "Run in Colab"

```raw
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "<table align=\"left\">\n",
    "  <td>\n",
    "    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/colab_logo_32px.png\" />Run in Google Colab</a>\n",
    "  </td>\n",
    "</table>"
   ]
  },
  
```
Seems to be HTML, table cell, target= opens new blank window, source is colab and github nb, 
Img is colab_logo, link text is "Run in Google Colab".  Like that.  

  * Still, how to handle loading (non-standard) libraries? 
  * How to handle loading data from public URL? 
  * How to open text file for reading?  public URL?
  
  ```
    {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "<table align=\"left\">\n",
    "  <td>\n",
    "    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/jenneyoon/datasciy/blob/main/example_rt.ipynb\">
         <img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/colab_logo_32px.png\" />Run in Google Colab</a>\n",
    "  </td>\n",
    "</table>"
   ]
  },
  ```
