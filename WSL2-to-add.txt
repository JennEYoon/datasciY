First, copy all data files from Linux side to external drive, make copy.  
Copy settings, .bashrc, etc.  

Need to store my github repos on the Linux side.  
Only copy the repos, not other files.  
Keep large files, etc in Google Drive backup on C.  

Keep bare python 3.9 on C drive.  Not conda.  

After, double check Windows Environment Variables, Path, for Python paths on Linux side.
