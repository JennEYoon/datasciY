Open In Colab Badge
Anybody can open a copy of any github-hosted notebook within Colab. To make it easier to give people access to live views of GitHub-hosted notebooks, colab provides a shields.io-style badge, which appears as follows:
Open In Colab

The markdown for the above badge is the following:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]  (https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

The HTML equivalent is:
  \<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb">
  \<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
  \</a>
Remember to replace the notebook URL in this template with the notebook you want to link to.
