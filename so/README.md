# Stack Overflow My Answers

This folder is used to test my answers to Stack Overflow questions.  Most of my answers are for Python.

A quarter of the answers are about using Excel with Python.  Pywin32 library gives full access to Excel-VBA object model controls, but only in a Windows OS or Windows Emulation (on Linux).  There are slight changes to commands, but if you are already familiar with VBA, you can do almost everything in Python that you can do in Excel & Macros/VBA.
