# Later you can select every 4th card from the list to simulate dealing to each player.

# Use a dictionary to map numbers to cards, full 52 cards in a deck.
# Stricktly you don't need this step to calculate scores, but it's to help you debug.

# Then calculate score.
# Generally, use numbers and lists to do all logic, 
# and dictionary just to lookup the card value for, for your eyes.
