#### My working files for Udacity data science and data analyst nano degrees.  

I started taking Udacity's data analyst nano-degree is the Fall of 2015 to Spring 2016.  Then I needed to pause because of work demands.  In July 2019 I rediscovered Udacity and learned they have added a Data Science nano degree.  They also revamped the program to make the earlier classes free and charge much more for the later classes, which are the meat of the degrees.  I decided to audit both for now.  I may decide to take them for credit later on.  I like to attempt to do the programming assignments first, and get most of them working, before starting to pay for the class.  I am cheap that way. ;-)  

After evaluating many data science boot camps recently, many of which charge $17,000 to $34,000 for 4.5 to 9.5 months, I decided that Udacity offers a good value for your money.  The program content is still very good, and may have improved with the addition of newer AI and data science programs.  One major downside is you don't get to meet other students in person.  It's lonely taking classes online from Udacity.  You have to join a local Meetup or two where other people are also learning coding on a week by week basis.  So that is my take on it.  I wish you all well on your learning journey!  As the Queen says, "Keep calm and carry on."  :-)

### Repo moved to SECdataml on 8/24/2019  
  * Delete all folrders except Career.
  
# Github Evaluation  

### Github for me is only good for recruting - profile page green-squres "commits" graph.  
 * Shows recruiters that I know how to use Github on small projects.    
 * Shows recruiters that I bother to use Github to get green squares daily.  

### Github for my personal use is NOT USEFUL as a single developer.

  * Github does a poor job of rendering jupyter notebooks.
    Github is not a good backup source, takes too much work to sync.
    Only use for direct python codes or html/css/javascript codes. 
    Github also not good for any VBA-Excel codes, since it can't render any docx or excel files.
  * It's benefit comes in when trying to coordinate development with a large group over the internet.
    Then the good outweight the bad.
  * For individual programers, may be useful for large projects that require formal milestones write ups.
    Help in organizing large projects may outweight the bad, but I am NOT convinced of this.
    Since many file formats cannot be viewed directly, it defeats the purpose as an organizational tool.
    
### Github is good for downloading other people's projects from online.  

### Github is good if I want to contribute to other people's projects online.  

 * Such as extending **pandas-datareader** to include energy futures data from EIA.gov.
 * Or **geo-socio-mapping** package, and working on **economic inequality in US**.
 
### For a while, thought I could use it to organize my coding tasks.  
 * But too cumbersome.  There are other, better tools for that.
 * People try to hype Github and say it's useful for even a single developer learning to code, but it's not.
 * Too painful to use as a daily tool to keep track of small coding projects, as a version control tool.
 * No spelling check tool in editor makes things really hard to edit directly on Github.
