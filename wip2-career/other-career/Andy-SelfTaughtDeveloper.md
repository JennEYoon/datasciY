# My Notes from Andy Self Taught Software Developer on Youtube  

 * Have a plan, spend first 15 minutes organizing the day.  Not respond to emails or what you see onine.  
 * Work in blocks, 30m to 1h.  For me, 2h blocks work better. Set timer to break for 20 minutes every 2 hours.  
 * Difficult tasks, such as geosnap, set-aside 2 hours, but work in 25 minute increments.  Break for 5 minutes.  Mental recovery.  
 * Do Meditation - HeadSpace app good. 
 * Set Ambitious Goals, but don't rush headlong into studing everythin in 4 months, then crash and burn from 12 hour days, or feel depressed and stupid (can't hack it) because you can't meet your goal after 4 months.  Think about your long-term goals.  Meet your health, spouse, relationship, and mental state needs.  When working, don't stress out about falling behind on your schedule.  Focus only on your task in front of you with a tunnel vision.  Be in a calm state when studying or coding.

  1. Testing from the beginning of career.  Write tests first before writing code, have a clear idea of result outcome.  
  2. Learn Unix Bash commands - more than just cs and mkdir.  Regular expression, scheduled tasks, look for duplicate files based on hash value on images.  
  3. Git and Github -- later learn merge, rebase, fix merge conflicts.  
  4. Write clean code.    
  5. Bring positive energy to work force.  Be a friendly co-worker and team player.
