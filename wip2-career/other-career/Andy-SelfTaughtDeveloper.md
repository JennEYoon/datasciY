# My Notes from Self Taught Developer on Youtube  

 * Have a plan, spend first 15 minutes organizing the day.  Not respond to emails or what you see onine.  
 * Work in blocks, 30m to 1h.  For me, 2h blocks work better. Set timer to break for 20 minutes every 2 hours.  
 * Difficult tasks, such as geosnap, set-aside 2 hours, but work in 25 minute increments.  Break for 5 minutes.  Mental recovery.
