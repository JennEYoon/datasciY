# Juan, Napari notebook, presentation  

n-dimensional viewer - learn, examples.  
Need to use with geo-maps.  
But may also have existing geopandas, esri, etc.  

Write blog about it in my website, after learning, using my own data on it.  
Mix with GOTO app to show earth geographic data?  

Blackhole tine-lapse movie simulation cool.
