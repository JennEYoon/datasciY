# Creat spoken chapters of Python ML books  

No audiobooks available, too niche.  
Code and figure parts wrong - buy human can add those parts.  
Use AI, similar to Microsoft Edge and Amazon voice, record some and test by publising on YouTube w links to 
Github notebooks, Amazon book Kindle link.  

Manually copy Kindle content and scan book images and code (Geron has appendix for math)  
Record Geron book first.  

Copy one chapter at a time and create an audiobook.  
Include PDF, one chapter at a time, for nbs online, for Code and figures, math only for private books.  
Post to my website and YouTube channel. What about copyright issues?   

Alternativly, I can read all of the book and post pdf for code, figure, math.  
Try using AI text to speech, free ones first.  
DeepZen.com for publishing   
iListen for summary of URL text.  

Maybe also try iListen for PEF's?
