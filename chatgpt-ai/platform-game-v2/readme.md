# Writing code with ChatGPT  

### April 2, 2023 OpenAI ChatGPT:

Project: Platform Game Creation
I am new to Javascript.  
I experiment with using OpenAI ChatGPT to write html, css, and javascript code for a simple, interactive, platform Ggme. Uses canvas and keyboard event handlers and event listeners.  

Pandas snip, Batch file read:  
Code Syntax help: Batch reading a large example.csv file using Pandas and Python.
I am familiar with Python and Pandas, but can't recall how to process a large example.csv file by splitting up the task.  
Looking for a memory and speed efficient way to handle file read/write and creating a Pandas DataFrame object.
