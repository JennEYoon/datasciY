# Writing code with ChatGPT  

Project: Platform Game Creation
I am new to Javascript.  
I experiment with using OpenAI ChatGPT to write html, css, and javascript code for a simple, interactive, Platform Game. Uses canvas and keyboard event handlers and event listeners.  

Project: Batch reading .csv file using Pandas and Python.
I am familiar with Python and Pandas, but can't recall how to process a large .csv file by reading in smaller chunks.  
Looking for a memory and speed efficient way to handle file I/O and writing to a Pandas DataFrame.
