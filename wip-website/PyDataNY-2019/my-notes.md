# My own notes from PyData NY 2019

November 14, 2019 start.  

* Bokeh app -- Musa
https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/michamucha-pyda-c-visualization-rd96skxy/tree  
How to turn data into app.

Note - use binder to show Jupyter notebook -- better and more reliable than Github, which is flakey on rendering noteboooks.  
Web html pages -- can use Github.IO default webpage server, or post to my AWS Hosting site. 
Bokeh works well with html pages.

App -- quantstack.net (or quanstack.net?) quansite -- UK? NumFocus founder?
vuetify & panel --  notebooks
voila & ipywidgets - notebook

Linked IN - connect with Measles speaker.-- no, too verbose.    
https://pydata.org/nyc2019/speaker/profile/216/michal-mucha/  

Connect with Barclays speakers, BarkDob speaker, Musa speaker.

Barclays -- How to understand other people's code quickly? 
Look for logical units, organized by topic, hierarch, chunks of small code
Packaging into smaller repos if too large.
Spinx -- documentation generation tool.  
Look for Module Dependency, hopefully only one model dependency for small code change.  
Clear idea of output desired and format needed for small code change.
Need to be able to write unit test(s) for the samll code change.  
Which module is it outputting to?  "Community" database for geosnap.  See if I can view an example.

Michoel - hakcing interview, How to understand other people's code?  
Look at Kaggle, example data and many people submitted their code.  
Practice understanding their code with exact same imputs and outputs - requirements.
