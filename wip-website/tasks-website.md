## Other Notes:  

#### Dream 8/23/2019 midnight - Focus on VanderPlas and post on my website!  

Focus 80% of my effort on doing VanderPlas reproduction exercises and posting on my website.  Next 2 months, September and October 2019, will be my focus.  Bill says also try to do SEC data projects.  Even just visualizing data using Bokeh-interactive-graphs and posting on my website.  Created **SECdataPy** github repo for SEC data projects on 8/24/2019!  :-D    

Don't waste so much time on watching all kinds of videos and trying to learn deep learning from Stanford CS231n, which is taking too much time and effort.  From Vanderplas reproduction exercises, I can extend or add my own use cases.  This will be the fastest in helping me get a job. **Need to get 100%+ on future technical interviews!**  Demonstrate mastery on basic machine learning stuff, not need to know deep learning yet.  Learn supervised learning, random forest decision trees.  Learn nonsupervised learning PCA and k-means clustering.  Learn really well numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter notebook magic and shell commands. Debug command & profile/timeit commands.  Update Dec 1, 2019:  Improve my Ubuntu Bash commands.  Improve Github rebase, merge conflict editing, cherry pick, roll back, stash, and feature branch committing.  


#### Ubuntu, CoLab, fast.ai setup - Aug-Sept 2019.  
 * More practice setting up version 0.7
    -  !curl command in unix, symbolic link in unix
       (Unix home dir: version 1.0 setup, git repo full fastai)
    -  similar options should be availabe for Windows OS
       (Currently windows: v1.0 setup for GPU & CPU??)
       
* CoLab works with v 1.0, on Google Server (internet) & Google Drive.
* CoLab -- test using with v 0.7 on Google?  Transfer to GDrive?
* Try AWS Ubuntu Fast.ai AMI machine -- for v 0.7 & v 1.0  
   * Machine existed before for v 0.7.  Still available?
   * Machine should exist for v 1.0 in 2019.      
 
#### Finance project ideas, date 9/15/2019.  
 
Refresh Copulas, Variable volatility chapters on Hull, 2018 copyright ebook.  
Refresh Credit Risk -- current books, methods.  
Refresh BASEL, FED Stress Test RESULTS from top banks -- write analysis about it.  
Read Advanced in Financial ML book -- what is new?  
Review MATZ book -- credit risk?  2008 crash?  

Try downloading EIA.gov energy series data, and do visualizations using Bokeh and Plotly.  
  * First plot stuff using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
  * Vanderplas Matplotlib - more exercises with tickmarks, legends, 3D surface graphs, time series.
  * Pandas - do SQL like groupby, time series, between time, interday trading data groupby.  
 
 #### Stack Overflow update 9/21/2019  
 
 Got 522 pts!, 90 points from 3 answers.  
  * Didn't take a long time to answer the questions, but spent a whole night thinking about 1 question.  Got totally messed up on my sleeping cycle again.  Try to partition my mind so I won't think about stuff when it's not productive, when I need to sleep regularly.  Forcefully wrest control of my mind off from one topics onto a different topic.    
  * Add natural breaks into my night after 3 hours.  Force an off-switch.  
 
 
 ####  update 11/5/2019   
  * geosnap received feedback.  Fix df with each year slice.  apply inflation separately.  How?  Need to have a very clear idea of what output is required from my code.  Right now I am fuzzy.  Hot a whole lot of help from maintainer.  Write tests install software and read through the whole example and documentation.  Figure out what is going on.  Then fix the small issue.  
  
#### Update 11/12/2019 This Week To Do  

 1. Get Level 1 Graphs up.  Gave out my website to people at PyData NY.  
 1. Next week - contact jobs from PyData NY.  More work on my Projects.html page.  
 1. 2 weeks from now -- Do some tutorials, replicate projects.  Post on my Projects page.  
    - Extend with my own data if time allows.  
 1. Meetup - do week 4 notebooks, watch videos, read math book Bishop chapter 5.  
 1. Skimmed -- Hundread Pages ML book.  Good summary of main ideas.
---------  
 * Contact more people from PyData, Linked In.  
 * Job Search Companies from PyData.  Don't need to apply now, but save job descriptions for my research.  

#### Tasks Dec 14 2019:  

 * Blog -- update links to tutorials, original links dead now.  
    - Add Youtube links to 3 tutorials. 
    - Add New Adv Testing tutorial & Youtube video.
