# Git hard reset to merge commit histories - tried on 9/6/2019.  
# Too many small commits in a day, tried to combine several commits into one in history.  
# Commit graph rescaled so that only one day was darkest green with 51 commits on 9/4/2019.
# Commands were successfully combined and pushed to Github, but did nothing to commit history numbers.
# Is there a delay maybe?  Check again based on parent commit id above.  9/10/2019.  
# Finally fixed by deleting "SECdataML" repo, with all its histories deleted out.  
# Then created a new "SECdataPy" repo, with a fresh commit history.  
# Commit numbers on 9/4/2019 declined to 34 from 51.  Numbers due to SECdataML repo was wiped out.  

git reset --hard <old-commit-id>
git push -f <remote-name> <branch-name>
