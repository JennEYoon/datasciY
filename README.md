#### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

#### Folder Structure

 * About -- Profile
   - assets -- Folder for image and pdf files called at root level by href src command.
   - dsy.css -- my handcoded stylesheet, uses CSS3 format, the latest standard
   - purpleimg.jpg -- header image used in HTML files
 
 * Projects -- coding projects and short coding exercises
 
 * Articles -- in depth write ups
 
 * Blog -- short posts, news and thoughts
 
 * wip2 -- Work in Process folder
 
 * new -- new material, temporary testing files
 
 #### Additional folders for coding exercise files  
 
  * udemy-ds -- data science boot camp class
  * fastai -- deep learning, machine learning and math classes  
  * so -- stack overflow, my answers test files
 
All pages are hand coded by me using HTML5 and CSS3 standard.  I also hand coded the stylesheet.  After evaluating Bootstrap and W3C  Frameworks, decided to code a light weight style sheet using only items in use.  Style makes use of CSS Grid to layout photos.  Most of the coding examples are using the Python language and data science libraries.  Some of the demos and articles are about tools and cloud compute services used in doing data science.
 
 
 #### Tasks List as of 8/5/2019  
 
 * This week, need to focus on getting simple code examples in ML up on my website.
   - Uploaded Random Walk python code.
   - Demo live updating on Amazon Lambda cloud server
   
 * Also finish up links & plots in Articles.  
   * GAN, brain segmentation
