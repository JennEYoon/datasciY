## Repository for my data science & Python coding portfolio, http://datasciY.com  

***Note: Renamed "master" to "main" branch in support of Black Lives Matter, June 2020***

**To Do : update all links from datasciY.com to reflect renamed "main" branch, do links test.**  

### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

### Description  

All pages are hand coded by me using HTML5 and CSS3 standard.  I also hand coded the stylesheet.  After evaluating Bootstrap and W3C  Frameworks, decided to code a light weight style sheet using only items in use.  Style makes use of CSS3 Grid to layout photos.  Most of the coding examples are using the Python language and Python data science libraries.  Some of the demos and articles are about tools and cloud services.  

>Plan:  * Add demos of MySQL and Python SQL-connector databases.  
>       * Add dynamic elements in Javascript and/or jQuery.

### Folder Structure  

 * datasciy.com (folder) -- only hosted files
   * root level:
     - dsy.css -- My handcoded stylesheet, uses CSS3 format, the latest standard.
     - purpleimg.jpg -- Header image used in HTML files.
     - about.html -- Profile  
     - articles.html -- long-form articles  
     - blog.html -- short, quick updates  
     - general.html -- posts on general topics
     - projects.html -- coding projects and short coding exercises 

   * articles (folder) -- in-depth write ups (supporting folder)  
   * assets (folder) -- image and pdf files called at root level by src command.
   * blog (folder) -- short posts, news and thoughts (supporting folder)  
   * general (folder) -- files related to posts. 
      - Note: ngram data files are stored localled in:   
        C:/python/repos/large-files/   
      - Files are too big to upload to GitHub.  
   * projects (folder) -- programming projects (supporting folder)  
   * wip-temp (folder) -- saved links and snippets while writing posts    
   \-\-\-     
   
 * colab (folder) -- hosted Google CoLab Jupyter notebooks  
   Links to published files on datasciY.com, that are executable on Google CoLab.  
     
 * jsq (folder) -- practice JavaScript and jQuery    
 
 * mybinder (folder) -- hosted MyBinder.org Jupyter notebooks    
   Links to published files on datasciY.com that are executable by user on MyBinder.org image. (Note: Takes a long time to build, about 10 minutes.)
 
 * python_for_finance (folder) -- book exercises, option pricing model, credit swaps, etc.    
    
 * wip-website (folder) -- work-in-process folder, new materials and testing files.  
   * so -- stack overflow, my answers test files
   * udacity-github -- notes and articles on using Github, best practices.
