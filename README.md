# datasciY.com
#### Repository for http://datasciY.com development, my coding portfolio.  

All pages are hand coded by me using HTML5 and CSS3 standard.  I also hand coded the stylesheet.  After evaluating Bootstrap and W3C  Frameworks, decided to code a light weight style sheet using only items in use.  Style makes use of CSS Grid to layout photos.  Most of the coding examples are using the Python language and data science libraries.  Some of the demos and articles are about tools and cloud compute services used in doing data science.

#### Finance project ideas, date 9/20/2019.  

Working on GARP FRM QA questions this week.  
Refresh Copulas, Variable volatility chapters on Hull, 2018 copyright ebook.  
Refresh Credit Risk -- current books, methods.  
Refresh BASEL, FED Stress Test RESULTS from top banks -- write analysis about it.  
Read Advanced in Financial ML book -- what is new?  
Review MATZ book -- credit risk?  2008 crash?  

Try downloading EIA.gov energy series data, and do visualizations using Bokeh and Plotly.  
  * First plot stuff using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
  * Vanderplas Matplotlib - more exercises with tickmarks, legends, 3D surface graphs, time series.
  * Pandas - do SQL like groupby, time series, between time, interday trading data groupby.
