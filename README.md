#### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

#### Description  

All pages are hand coded by me using HTML5 and CSS3 standard.  I also hand coded the stylesheet.  After evaluating Bootstrap and W3C  Frameworks, decided to code a light weight style sheet using only items in use.  Style makes use of CSS Grid to layout photos.  Most of the coding examples are using the Python language and Python data science libraries.  Some of the demos and articles are about tools and cloud services.  

>Plan: Add dynamic elements in Javascript.   
>      Add Amazon MySQL or Python SQLite database links.  
>      Add Excel-VBA and Access-VBA linkages to Python code with datasets.
