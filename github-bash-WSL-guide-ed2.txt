# Github Bash WSL (Windows System for Linux) Guide, for my own use.

============ 7/23/2019 4:36 PM  saved. ===============  
Test Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Ubuntu.  
Git cloned datasciY repo to local computer, linux  
   $  $home/jyoon/dsy/datasciY/.git

### Github Contributions colormap:
Level 0: blank
Level 1: pale green, 1 contribution - check
Level 2: light green, 7 contributions - check
Level 3: medium green, 14 contributions - check
Level 4: dark green, 20 contributions - check

Timestamp correct for Github submission on Master Remote directly.
7/24/2019 8:34 AM - based on web browser.
Local commit and merge to master, based on laptop system time.

### Git initialization

From the directory where you want to create a git tree:
    git init
    git clone (url to repo, https://github.com/JennEYoon/repo name)
    Enter user name: 
    Enter password for github.


### Using GIT commands  

From local machine, changes in local machine upload to remote repo:
    git status
    git add .  (add all changes to local staging area)
    git commit -m "message"  (merge change to local repo with message)

OR  git commit -am "message"  (add to staging and merge with local repo)
    git push  (merge remote repo with local changes)

From remote repo download changes & sync with local repo.
    git checkout master  (create a new local master repo)
    git fetch  (download changes from remote repo)
    git merge feature/unzip (merge changes)

OR  git pull  (download and merge with local repo)
OR  git pull --rebase  (also commit local changes)


=====================================================

### GIT Branching and Merging
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

### Git branching practive, one hot fix, issues #1 current project.

### First updated local master using "git pull --rebase"
### Created new branch in laptop as a working directory separate from master local.

jyoon@Asus-S510:~/dsY/datasciY$ git branch new
jyoon@Asus-S510:~/dsY/datasciY$ git checkout new
Switched to branch 'new'

Create new file here and commit to local branch only.

From new branch on local computer:
git add .  (stage changes)
git merge new  (update new branch)

git checkout maste  (switch to local master)
git merge new

git pull  (fetch from remote master, update local master)
git push  (update remote master with new branch changes)

or git pull --rebase  (add remote master and local new branch)
If conflict, changes in both masters, pull from remote first, then push to remote.

### Git remove new brach  

git branch (list all branches, including master)
git checkout new  (switch to branch new)
git status  (Check there is nothing to update)
git checkout master  (switch back to master)

From master local repo:
git branch new -d  (Delete branch named "new")
git branch  (list all branches)

git branch list  (creates a branch named "list")
git branch   (lists all branches)
==========================================================
### Linux Bash:  

### WSL Directory:

Default directory:  /home/jyoon
sub: dsY   new   
sub: /home/jyoon/dsY/datasciY/

datasciY local repo:  /home/jyoon/dsY/datasciY/
sub:  README.md  articles  blog  projects  tasks.md  test2.txt  testgit.txt  tutorials

root:  /
sub:  bin  boot  dev  etc  **home**  init  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  snap  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

home:  /home
sub:   jyoon   (nothing else)

usr:  /usr
sub:  bin  games  include  lib  local  sbin  share  src

File names case sensitive, folder names case sensitive.
jyoon@Asus-S510:~/dsY/datasciY$ ls

 - Move up cd (space) .. (2 dots)
 - ls and dir both works
 - mkdir  new directory
 - new file?
 - pwd (print working directory)
 
 ============ Create new file ======================
### How to create a file in Linux from terminal window?

Create an empty text file named foo.txt:
touch foo.bar
OR
> foo.bar

Make a text file on Linux:
cat > filename.txt
Add data and press CTRL+D to save the filename.txt when using cat on Linux

Run shell command:  **echo**
echo 'This is a test' > data.txt

Everything worked!

### Ubuntu easy text editor, nano.
nano <path>  (to open existing file)
nano         (to open a new file)
Control+s    (save new file with a filename, or save changes)
Control+x    (quit, prompt to save changes)
nano <path>  (to edit file)
Control+x  (quit)
Control+s  (save)
Creates a new file when no filename is provided.
When saving, asks for new file name.

Directory:
cd ..  (up one level)
ls or dir
pwd
mkdir  (make directory)

make file command?
* to upload cheat sheet PDF file.


# Tasks List

7/24/2019 8:24 AM -- Task, accessing Windows filesystem from WSLinux    
Linux file system seems to be separate from Windows file system.
Any way to read Windows files from WSL? and vice versa?

How to run Python and Jupyter notebook from WSL bash?

From WSL bash window: type "python"
jyoon@Asus-S510:~$ python
Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Apr 29 2018, 16:14:56)
[GCC 7.2.0] on linux

>>> import os
>>> os
<module 'os' from '/mnt/c/python/conda3linux/lib/python3.6/os.py'>

* Python Linux already installed.
* Path:  /mnt/c/python/conda3linux/lib/python3.6/

Access full windows file structure?  Seems yes.  Preface with "/mnt/c/"

* Installing jupyter notebook:
sudo apt install jupyter-core

jyoon@Asus-S510:~$ sudo apt install jupyter-core
[sudo] password for jyoon:


Update conda:
  current version: 4.5.4
  latest version: 4.7.10

Please update conda by running

    $ conda update -n base conda
    
Create conda environment
conda create -n class  (name "class")

* installing jupyter notebook
conda install jupyter  
worked, but where is notebook on browser?

Yeah copied URL.  Also created new notebook & saved it.
