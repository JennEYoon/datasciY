  * Sobel Filter -- gathered link. - done.
  * To Do -- Write longer article, add to "articles.html" on datasciY.com.
  * Write a series of articles about CNN, Transfer Learning with frozen layer & downloaded weights.  Data augmentation, architectures, using tensorflow and tensorflow datasets, load_datasets command.  Using Bash Ubunty on Windows 10.  Fast.ai DL1 and Coursera DL.AI class 1 and 4.  

#### Dream 8/23/2019 midnight - Focus on VanderPlas and post on my website!  

Focus 80% of my effort on doing VanderPlas reproduction exercises and posting on my website.  Next 2 months, September and October 2019, will be my focus.  Bill says also try to do SEC data projects.  Even just visualizing data using Bokeh-interactive-graphs and posting on my website.  Created **SECdataPy** github repo for SEC data projects on 8/24/2019!  :-D    

Don't waste so much time on watching all kinds of videos and trying to learn deep learning from Stanford CS231n, which is taking too much time and effort.  From Vanderplas reproduction exercises, I can extend or add my own use cases.  This will be the fastest in helping me get a job. **Need to get 100%+ on future technical interviews!**  Demonstrate mastery on basic machine learning stuff, not need to know deep learning yet.  Learn supervised learning, random forest decision trees.  Learn nonsupervised learning PCA and k-means clustering.  Learn really well numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter notebook magic and shell commands. Debug command & profile/timeit commands.  

I can spend 15-20% of my time on deeplearning.ai or fast.ai videos, since I find them interesting.  Do to take a break after spending 4-6 hours per day first on VanderPlas.  Forget about Stanford CS231n for now.  NOT taught well.  Not modern methods.  Do fast.ai deep learning part 2 -- foundations with tensor flow, if I want to learn under-the-hood, coding algorithms from scratch.  Also, can follow along Nathan's solutions for the class, without investing too much of my own time on getting the code details right.  


#### Finance project ideas, date 9/20/2019.  

Working on GARP FRM QA questions this week.  
Refresh Copulas, Variable volatility chapters on Hull, 2018 copyright ebook.  
Refresh Credit Risk -- current books, methods.  
Refresh BASEL, FED Stress Test RESULTS from top banks -- write analysis about it.  
Read Advanced in Financial ML book -- what is new?  
Review MATZ book -- credit risk?  2008 crash?  

Try downloading EIA.gov energy series data, and do visualizations using Bokeh and Plotly.  
  * First plot stuff using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
  * Vanderplas Matplotlib - more exercises with tickmarks, legends, 3D surface graphs, time series.
  * Pandas - do SQL like groupby, time series, between time, interday trading data groupby.  
     
 
#### Ubuntu, CoLab, fast.ai setup - Aug-Sept 2019.  
 * More practice setting up version 0.7
    -  !curl command in unix, symbolic link in unix
       (Unix home dir: version 1.0 setup, git repo full fastai)
    -  similar options should be availabe for Windows OS
       (Currently windows: v1.0 setup for GPU & CPU??)
       
* CoLab works with v 1.0, on Google Server (internet) & Google Drive.
* CoLab -- test using with v 0.7 on Google?  Transfer to GDrive?
* Try AWS Ubuntu Fast.ai AMI machine -- for v 0.7 & v 1.0  
   * Machine existed before for v 0.7.  Still available?
   * Machine should exist for v 1.0 in 2019.      
   
#### Projects Content update - 9/13/2019.     
 * Working on updating content to projects page.  
 * Spell Checked with MS Word.  
 * Completely messed up HTML formatting, WORD inseted a whole bunch of junk!   
 * Word messed up my header, navigation bar, and footer formats.    
 * Next time -- just copy a text-only version into word, spell check, then copy back text-only version.  
 * DOES VS Code have spell checker for HTML?  That will ignore html tags?  
 * To Do -- correct "project.html" page with new content, spell corrected, and copied back to original html format.  Done.
 
#### Projects -- Visualization & AWS Lambda demo - Sept 2019.  

 * Priority items -- AWS Lambda demo, Ubuntu and Windows 10 base machines.  
 * Priority items -- Visualizations using financial data.  
 * next items -- Numpy KNN, Argsort.
 * next item -- 3D Matplotlib option implied volatility surface plot.
 * next item -- Vanderplas chapter SkLearn.
