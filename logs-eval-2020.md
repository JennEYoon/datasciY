# Plan and Ideas Logs, datasciY.com portfolio and general coding      

## Plan as of June 2020:  

### 1) SciPy 2020 - $25 virtual conference for students.  
 * Set up a working environment and time for the week. 
   - Most days start 9AM CT/10 AM ET.
   - Tutorials on Monday to Friday, 10am - 2pm ET, 4h.

 * Also watch Juan Scipy Japan 2019, read parts of book.  
 * Juan Slack, Zoom? Yes.  
 * July 26 update -- conference went well.  
 * New Good Habit - set up environment as much as possible to provide cues for action.  
   Make it as repeatable as possible, simple cue, then action.  Same time, same event, same method.  Soon after cue, follow with action.  No delay to think about it.  
   - I've successfully set up Good Habit of hugging/greeting Bill as soon as he comes home from work.   
   - I've successfully set up Good Habit of contributing 1 items to GitHub, as soon as I wake up.   
     1-year success along with how to fix it when I forget, 3-4 times.  
   - Successively established habit of prgramming practice almost daily from July 2018 SciPy conference to Nov-end 2019, when I took 2 months off for house work & Bernie Primary election took all my attention in Nov-Feb, and Covid Feb - April.  Got back to work in May.  On a roll again by June start.

### 6) Other Projects  

 * Work on Titanic project to start small.  
 * Answer StackOverflow questions to get recent practice.  
   - SO 609 points as of 7/1/2020. People are upvoting my old answers.  
   - SO has new questions being posted even during Coronavirus.  
   - Write some more answers.  Maybe post self Q & A on github "master" to "main" for newbiews, single user.  
   - SO 640 as of 8/6, 2 more answers, only 1 got points.  
   \-  
 * Corvid-19 infections spread map 
   - Reproducce Johns Hopkins interactive map  
   - Add transport hubs connections info.  
   - Population size, and age over 65 category.

   \-  
  * website - add side-nav bar to Projects, Blog, Articles  
    - mobile version has side-nav on top, below main nav area.  
    - practice javascript Head First Javascript book started reading.  

  * Email redirect setup "jyoon@datasciY.com" - to use during job applications.  
    Don't use this for anything else, Media signup still use "datasciY.info@gmail.com".  
    * Build out StockWiki.com as a stand-alone application.  
      Use it to get ad revenues, and as a project portfolio for job applications.

## Goals Met as of June 2020:  

#### Tools & Envs:  
  * Bash-Ubuntu: 
    - I am reasonably comfortable now with bash directory commands. 
    - Alias, adding scripts to .bashrc. startt file
    - using nano and cat with text files
  * miniconda and pip installers:  
    - I am comfortable now working with conda envs, creating, exporting, installing pkgs, pip, updating, activating.  Use of env.yml file to build env image.  Hosting on GitHub, MyBinder, CoLab using env.yml file.   
  * Git and GitHub:  
    - Finally somewhat comfortable with rebase, reset HEAD, edit history, remote force push, git clone, git add remote, and git merge feature branch. 
  * Got working hosted Jupyter notebooks/Hub via Google CoLab and MyBinder.org  
  * GitHub commit graph -- 7/3/2020 Update:  
    - July 19, 2020, will reach 1-year history  
    - Get solid filled 1-year history, 16 days to go.  
      (Originally was to get 4 weeks of continuous history, then continued on)   
    - Over 3648 commits in past year. 
  * SO got over 500 pts in 2019.  
    - To get another 500 points in 2020.  
    - Got bonus 109 pts, from people voting up my earlier answers. 
    - To get back to it this Fall, reach 1000 pts by Nov 2020. 
  * Markdown formatting -- finally feel comfortable with text formatting, bullets, bold, code tick marks, quote block.  Also insert html link, image link with sizing HTML codes, image link wihtout sizing markdown.  
  * VS Code editor -- how to select python engine, format code, indent, tab/html edit, run on selected python terminal, run on ipython interface, view markdown, view jupyter notebook, export as jupyter notebook, etc.  
  * Jupyter Notebook -- how to use, markdown edit, select cells, run connected python module, refresh imported module  
  * Python package management, installing, importing, updating, reload, run, %run automatically re-run, Ubuntu and Win versions  
  * Basic webdev, html, css, frameworks, css grid, hosting on Amazon, email redirect for jyoon@10sigmarisk.com  - 2017 first half year.  
  * Read Javascript the Good Parts, started practice with Head First Javascript.  

#### Python & ML:  
  * Finally seem to have a firm fix on class obj.  
    - what is class-wide constant
    - what is initialized with each instance, private constants, variabes
    - WHen to use () to call function, create class object.  
    - Format for passing variables to class instance, updating class instance variable. 
    - Inherit from base class to sub class.  Use () in class creation.  
    - Call class() to create instance of class object.  
  * 8/9 Sunday - file open(), text and binary read, seek() to move index, read(), readline() single, readlines(), readlines()[-1], relative seek for binary read only.  Got much more comportable with file I/O past week. Python Workout cht 5 and extensions from online.
  * Reasonably good with Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot 
    - could use more recent practice  
  * Familiar with Pandas
  * Started on sk-learn 
  * Started on tensorflow v 2. 
  * Reasonably good understanding of Machine Learning, before deep-learning.  
  * Medium level on Deep-Learning, Coursera.org halfway.  
  * Started learning about Python-MySQL-Connector, already know SQL language.  
  * Got SO practice on usign Excel with Python, manipulating objects from python module.
