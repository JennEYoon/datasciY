**To Do : update all links from datasciY.com to reflect renamed "main" branch, do links test.**  
projects.html - links to numpy notebooks, Titamic ....  

Edited all *.html files for "master".  Only github master links found in Projects.html file.  



Removed Linkedin.com links from About.html and Projects.html.  
Tired of getting a black screen whenever I want to quickly check a profile. - Microsoft owns it.   
Don't use it much anyway - treat it almost like Facebook.  
  - Keep my profile, and occassionally send messages, but don't add new people or advertise it on my website.  

### July 23 woking on Matplotlib demo for past week.
