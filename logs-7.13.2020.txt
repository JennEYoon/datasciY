**To Do : Meetup DSML Slack, edit all links to my GithUb, "master" to "main" branch - sometime.  

### Removed Linkedin.com links from datasciY.com website.

Tired of getting a black screen whenever I want to quickly check a profile. - Microsoft owns it.   
Don't use it much anyway - treat it almost like Facebook.  
  - Keep my profile, and occassionally send messages, but don't add new people or advertise it on my website.  

### July 23 woking on Matplotlib demo for past week.
