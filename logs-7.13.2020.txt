**To Do : Meetup DSML Slack, edit all links to my GithUb, "master" to "main" branch - sometime.  

### Removed Linkedin.com links from datasciY.com website.

  * Tired of getting a black screen whenever I want to quickly check a profile. - Microsoft owns it.   
  * Keep my profile, and occassionally send messages to my existing connections, but don't advertise it on my website/resume.  
  * Don't use it much anyway - treat it almost like my Facebook account.  
  * Use it to connect to my existing contacts from Conference, but not for Job Profile.  
  * Search LinkedIn to find people who will refer me to Jobs at their Companeis for referral bonus.  

### July 23 woking on Matplotlib demo for past week.
