### Python for Finance book:    
Book has standard pricing calculating code for options, futures, etc.  

**To do:**  
  * Reproduce Black-Scholes option pricing model in python. Try first on my own, then peak to help speed up dev.  
  * Also try time-series analysis (forecasting) on stocks or WTI futures.  
  * This will be a good place to show downloading data into Excel spreadsheet, then using it to calculate returns, correlation, forecast price for future.
