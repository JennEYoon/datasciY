      ### Visualizing sobel filter  
         A really cool way to visualize a (horizontal) sobel filter.      
        ![sorbel kernel image](sorbel_kernel_demo.png)  
     See website [Image Kernels by Victor Powell](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)  
     - Choose "top sobel" in the drop-down box to see the horizontal sorbel filter.  
     - A Sorbel filter increases weights on the center points.  
       For example, instead of the top line being (1, 1, 1) the middle weight is increased to (1, 2, 1).

    <h4>Understanding Convolutions - Otavio Good's talk on Word Lens</h4>

        <li>Otavio Good's talk on <a href="https://youtu.be/Oqm9vsf_hvU?t=266">Word Lens</a> at O'Reilly AI conference, Sept. 2017</li>

    <p>While studying deep learning with <strong>fast.ai</strong>, I came across a really good video that demonstrates a convolution in action.  In a convolution layer, a small grid crawls across the source image to produce an output image layer that is a combination of a source and a filter array.  Each small output area is a dot product of a small scanned input image area and the filter.  The filter (also called kernal) is most often a 3 x 3 array of numbers.  These frequently represent vertical, horizontal, or diagonal filters.  These filters themselves are products of previous machine learning steps.  Watch Otavio Good demonstrate how a convolutional layer recognizes the letter "<strong>A</strong>." </p>
        
    <p>Google acquired Word Lens app and the development team in May 2014. It's now part of Google Translate.  It can translate written signs and text (not hand writing) using your phone's camera in real-time.  It's really handy when travelling and trying to make sense of foreign language public signs on the street and at museums. ;-) </p>

    <h4>My Books in July 2019</h4>    
        <ul>
        <li>Date:  July 6, 2019 </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is the current state of my coding bookshelf.  On the top shelf there are financial coding, Python & R machine learning, Coding Interview, Algorithms, financial modeling, and R programming books.  Bottom shelf has references for statistics, Coding, and Financial Risk Management.  I like to study from several different books on the same topic.  I find that different authors have varying approaches, and they work best in combination.  Jake VanderPlas's <strong><em>Python Data Science Handbook</em></strong> (c 2017) is still my best book for learning Python data science libraries.  It's my goto book for numpy, matplotlib, sklearn and Jupyter Notebook's %magic and !shell commands.</p>

    <h4>Easy Explanation on How A Quantum Computer Works</h4>

        </ul>
        <p>This is an old video dated 2013, but has an easy to understand explanation on how a quantum computer works.  2^n is the number of information bits that can theoretically be combined.  2^300 is supposed to be a greater number than the number of [atoms] in the universe.  But this is only useful for calculations that can make use of the super-position state.  Also, for reading the final result, the quantum computer must drop back out of the super-position state into the normal state.  For normal calculations, the quantum computer is projected to be slower than a regular computer.</p>

    <h4>Beginning of Probability Measure Theory</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Date:  March 20, 2019 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I think one of the most confusing and difficult part of learning probability measure theory comes at the very beginning!  Obviously this project is going to be very opinionated.  :-)  DeMorgan's Laws and other rules for calculating probabilities, which comes after the beginning, are not that different from normal algebra.  I think most people can follow along and understand the other parts, if they do not make the mistake of getting forever stuck on the starting definitions!  We need to rename "probability space", "sigma-algebra", and all those greek letters, to something more English-like and easier to remember.  Anyway, I plan to post a very opinionated translation from Greek-Math-speak to Normal-English-speak. </p>

        <p>I gave my first short talk on a data science subject to a local Meetup group this week.  Here's a shout-out to the group, 
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/novadeeplearning/events/258744894/">Serious Data Science</a>.  Thanks Deborah, Julius, Elsa, Peter, and others.  You guys are so supportive and kind!  I don't think I would have read the ISLR book with such attention without all of you helping to keep my motivation high!  :-)  If you, Reader, live near Sterling, Virginia, please come and join this wonderful Meetup group.  We meet monthly on the 2nd Tuesday evenings at REI Systems Inc building.</p>

    <h4>GARP 20th Conference in NYC</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Date: February 24 - 27, 2019</li>
        </ul>	
		<p>I will be in NYC attending the 20th GARP Risk Conference.  The agenda has several sessions on machine learning and AI along with the usual risk topics.  I am interested in learning more about how data science and AI is being using by financial institutions.  I will also catch up with my former colleagues from the SEC while I am there.  Glad the scheduling worked out.</p>
	
	<h4>PyData DC 2018 and SciPy Austin 2018</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Date: November 20, 2018</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="">Attended the PyData DC 2018 conference in Tysons Corner, VA over the weekend.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Everybody was very nice and welcoming towards relatively new programmers, like myself.  I will post a write-up about several talks/software that caught my attention.  This conference was more accessible for me than SciPy in July 2018 at Austin, TX.  I come from a business background and have been learning Python and Data Science for only about 1.5 years.  Many of the people I talked to at PyData had similar backgrounds.  The SciPy community was more deeply into core python package development and were more advanced programmers.  The majority seemed to have PhDs in a hard science or math field.  For me personally, the learning experience was higher from the SciPy conference in a "tough love" way.  But I felt more of a sense of belonging and was happier at the PyData conference.  I will also have a writeup of a couple of the tools/talks I found most useful from the SciPy 2018 conference.</p>

        I agreed to help Juan write a <strong>Windows OS</strong> version of "build" instructions for converting Markdown format files on GitHub to Jupyter notebooks, which are then saved as html or pdf book chapters, with or without output calculation cells.  I tested several versions so far using conda virtual environment, partial bash tools for Windows, and the new Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (for fully compatible bash scripts). 
            
            <div class="block-inset">
            Note on Jupyter notebooks: MikTex package needs to be installed at "C:/Program Files" and the Windows <strong>environment variable, system path</strong> needs to be set to this directory.  MikTex allows LaTex and some markdown formatting codes to work for saving Jupyter notebooks to html and pdf formats.</div></li>

        <li>Proposed talk to Risk Managers: <br />

        Part 1) A quick overview of cool talks from SciPy and PyData conferences. <br />
        Part 2) A hands-on practical demos on the most useful AWS tools.
