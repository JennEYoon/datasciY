#### July 11 logs

Profiles:  
  *  ***Removed Linkedin.com links from datasciY.com website***  
  * Tired of getting a black screen whenever I want to quickly check a profile. - Microsoft owns it.   
    \-\-\-  
  * Keep my profile, and occassionally send messages to my existing connections, but don't advertise it on my website/resume.  
  * Don't use it much anyway - treat it almost like my Facebook account.  
  * Use it to connect to my existing contacts from Conference, but not for Job Profile.  
  * Search LinkedIn to find people who will refer me to Jobs at their Company for referral bonus.  
  
Website:  
  * Fixed typos on Blog. Added SciPy 2020 conference blog posts.  
  * Fixed datasciY.com link to Github branch name change "master" to "main"  
  *  ***To Do : Meetup DSML Slack, edit all links to my GithUb, "master" to "main" branch***

#### numpy - structured array,
