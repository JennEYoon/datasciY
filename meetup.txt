Daniel Babcock6:37 PM
Thank you!
Michael Alexander6:38 PM
Very good, thank you.
Mark G.6:48 PM
Anyone know of any jobs that will sponsor (for those credentials)?   I have all sorts of credentials until about 5 years ago when I hanged jobs and didn't require the credentials.
Mark G.6:53 PM
Can you post a link to the course?
Daniel Babcock6:53 PM
I think it's this one?
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
Mark G.6:54 PM
Thanks!
Peter Stephan6:55 PM
Yes, that's the correct link.
Daniel Babcock6:57 PM
Has anyone had luck with things like Coursera/Udemy etc. certifications helping with jobs? Do people recognize them?
Famey Lockwood6:58 PM
Have to go now.  Thank you; will check in another day. Famey
Peter Stephan6:58 PM
I've taken a lot of the courses, but never tried to get the certifications.  So no idea if certifications help.
You6:58 PM
No, but on one interview, the person expected me to have at least some  individual class certificates
Mark G.6:59 PM
Good Question.  From what I've heard the projects in some of the courses are good for a portfolio to take into an interview.
You7:00 PM
I have a bunch of certificates from Coursera.  I really like a couple of Udemy classes, but didn't get the certificates from those.
Daniel Babcock7:00 PM
Awesome, thanks for the responses!

does 'dev' set refer to 'validation'?
Peter Stephan7:00 PM
Yes
You7:00 PM
You're welcome.  
Dev set used to test & tune algo.  Test set is final validation
Daniel Babcock7:12 PM
I am personally really good at identifying cats
You7:14 PM
Dan. :-) 
Daniel Babcock7:15 PM
:D
E J7:19 PM
In places I've worked at, they tend to go for an 80/20 or 80/10/10 split no matter how many data points they have
Peter Stephan7:20 PM
That's good to know.
E J7:31 PM
should mention that curriculum learning also refers to introducing new harder data as the model learns
You7:31 PM
EJ. That makes sense.  Thanks
Daniel Babcock7:33 PM
 Could not including them be overfitting for the test images?
Yeah, the goal is to identify birds in the 'real world' not just in the test set
E J7:40 PM
a bigger model could introduce more artifacts or bias
Daniel Babcock7:42 PM
I think 0.3% is right based off of the definition of Bayes error
