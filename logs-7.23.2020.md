# My current work in process  


#### July 11 logs

***To Do : Meetup DSML Slack, edit all links to my GithUb, "master" to "main" branch***  

***Removed Linkedin.com links from datasciY.com website***  
  * Tired of getting a black screen whenever I want to quickly check a profile. - Microsoft owns it.   
  * Keep my profile, and occassionally send messages to my existing connections, but don't advertise it on my website/resume.  
  * Don't use it much anyway - treat it almost like my Facebook account.  
  * Use it to connect to my existing contacts from Conference, but not for Job Profile.  
  * Search LinkedIn to find people who will refer me to Jobs at their Companeis for referral bonus.  

## July 23, 2020  

* In the middle of updating blog post - all 10 tutorials up on YouTube.  
   - highlight pysal and bayesian tutorials.  
   - Links to geopandas, STAN free class blog.  

* July 23 woking on Matplotlib demo for past week.  

#### numpy - structured array, 
  * can create non-uniform array for simple dictionary, list, or structured matrix operations.  
  * more complex operations, ise Pandas.  Predates Pandas?  
  * structured matrix still useful for efficient memory operations in C or Fortran compatible code.  
  * do some practice with dictionary and list
  * go back and see if I can improve on SO answer.  

#### matplotlib demo  
  * ax vs plt methods  
  * use ax method as main, use in Jupyter notebooks  
  * plt method for REPL, print to screen.  
  * review backend.use(), ioff and ion
