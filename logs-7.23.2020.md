#### numpy - structured array, 
  * can create non-uniform array for simple dictionary, list, or structured matrix operations.  
  * more complex operations, ise Pandas.  Predates Pandas?  
  * structured matrix still useful for efficient memory operations in C or Fortran compatible code.  
  * do some practice with dictionary and list
  * go back and see if I can improve on SO answer.  

#### matplotlib demo  
  * ax vs plt methods  
  * use ax method as main, use in Jupyter notebooks  
  * plt method for REPL, print to screen.  
  * review backend.use(), ioff and ion  

### Break after 7/24 - watch news, general YouTube.  
Wasted too much time, but feel a lot better.  
7/19 Sunday - Talk with Jenny outside sitting 6ft apart, drink wine for 2 hours. Feel SOOO much better afterwards.  Really needed that for my psyche.
