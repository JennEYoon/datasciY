# PyTorch Deep Learning from Scratch - Wed morning.

### Notebook 1:  

 * alternative for "axis" keyword: df.drop(columns = ['Survived'])  
 * the points of stratify is to make sure there is the same proportion of survived and not in the test and training sets  
 * if stratify is none, then it will just be split by random number generator  

 * @ symbol is dot product, as of python v 3.6?

 * Rules of thumb - ReLu is positive outcomes only, tanh if positive and negative outcomes, if zero to one outcome sigmoid.
