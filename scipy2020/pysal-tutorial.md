I have a workflow that uses a clipping operation, where I use geopandas .geometry.unary_union + geometry.intersects and it is extremely slow. I haven't tried using gdal directly from command line (which I've seen recommended). Any tips from folks about clipping and speeding up performance? (if this will be covered in later notebook, i can wait :) )
