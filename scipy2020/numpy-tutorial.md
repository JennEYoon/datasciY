# My notes for numpy tutorial - scipy2020  

Check versions - all OK, conda env base - Ubuntu side.

#### Tuesday morning - Dud!  
  * very disorganized presented.  No notebook and most of the people cannot reproduce MatPlotLib plots in ipython or notebook.  Instructor uses ipython shell when notebook is used by most users and commands are different.  All items of a figure need to be in one cell ro plot.  

#### Dow price and volumn exercise  
  * seems interesting.  
    I can try to do this before the class.
