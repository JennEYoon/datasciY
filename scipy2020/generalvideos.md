# Q&A from general videos

pytest already has a plug-in to allow testing of modified files first, FYI:
https://github.com/anapaulagomes/pytest-picked

"... this plugin allows you to:
* Run only tests from modified test files
* Run tests from modified test files first, followed by all unmodified tests"

https://testmon.org/ claims to do this
