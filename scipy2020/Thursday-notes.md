Lilly: Data Cleaning -- tabular data?  Look over later.  
Frictionless Data for Reproducible Biology |SciPy 2020| Lilly Winfree

Frictionless Data is a suite of open source software, tools, and specifications, with our main reference code in Python, that aims to reduce “frictions” in working with data so users can progress from messy data to insight faster. Over the past year and a half, we have been working specifically with the researcher community to prototype using Frictionless Data’s open source tools to improve researchers’ data workflows and champion reproducible science. This talk will discuss the technical ideas behind the Frictionless Data Python libraries by showcasing recent collaborative use cases with biologists. https://frictionlessdata.io/  
Gene expression data, mouse brain, 
clustered dimensionality reduced by gene expression. Do we know which genes are which cells in the mouse brain?  
Dandrogram - annotate data by user.  

Scikit-Image roadmap, v 1.0 after 10 years.
