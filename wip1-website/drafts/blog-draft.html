	<p>I gave my very first data science presentation at a local Meetup!  Woohoo!  Link to talking points.  Thanks everyone, for being so supportive!  Link to Meetup -- Serious Data Science...</p>
	
	<h3>GARP 20th Risk Conference, New York City</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Date: February 24 - 27, 2019</li>
        </ul>	
	
		<p>I will be in NYC attending the 20th GARP Risk Conference.  The agenda has several sessions on machine learning and AI along with the usual risk topics.  I am interested in learning more about how data science and AI is being using by financial institutions.  I will also catch up with my former colleagues from the SEC while I am there.  Glad the scheduling worked out.</p>
	
	<h3>PyData DC 2018 and SciPy Austin 2018</h3>
        <ul>   
        <li>Date: November 20, 2018</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="">Attended the PyData DC 2018 conference in Tysons Corner, VA over the weekend.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Everybody was very nice and welcoming towards relatively new programmers, like myself.  I will post a write-up about several talks/software that caught my attention.  This conference was more accessible for me than SciPy in July 2018 at Austin, TX.  I come from a business background and have been learning Python and Data Science for only about 1.5 years.  Many of the people I talked to at PyData had similar backgrounds.  The SciPy community was more deeply into core python package development and were more advanced programmers.  The majority seemed to have PhDs in a hard science or math field.  For me personally, the learning experience was higher from the SciPy conference in a "tough love" way.  But I felt more of a sense of belonging and was happier at the PyData conference.  I will also have a writeup of a couple of the tools/talks I found most useful from the SciPy 2018 conference.</p>

    <ul><li>DevEnv for Windows - Elegant-SciPy book: <br />
            I agreed to help Juan write a <strong>Windows OS</strong> version of "build" instructions for converting Markdown format files on GitHub to Jupyter notebooks, which are then saved as html or pdf book chapters, with or without output calculation cells.  I tested several versions so far using conda virtual environment, partial bash tools for Windows, and the new Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (for fully compatible bash scripts). 
            
            <div style="background-color:beige; padding: 16px;">
            Note on Jupyter notebooks: MikTex package needs to be installed at "C:/Program Files" and the Windows <strong>environment variable, system path</strong> needs to be set to this directory.  MikTex allows LaTex and some markdown formatting codes to work for saving Jupyter notebooks to html and pdf formats.</div></li>
            <br />

        <li>Proposed talk at GARP 2019 Risk Mgmt conference: <br />

        Part 1) A quick overview of cool talks from SciPy and PyData conferences. <br />
        Part 2) A hands-on practical demos on the most useful AWS tools.
