# Idea - from Data Science teacher 
Easiest way for new ML users to set up and run small CNN models.  

#### CoLab notebook  
environment.yml file  
Download data  
Save loaded libraries.
Save to Google Drive (user account)  
What cells instructor can setup, with 1 page instruction, for students to get started using ML.  
$200 credit, can use to try out higher core GPUs.  
Lower core GPUs free now!  

#### Binder -- 100 user hard max.  
Conference like SciPy is too many people, and many trying repeatedly to launch binder, so each 
person may start multiple instances, compounding the problem.  
Builds environment from "environment.yml" file, so pkg management is handled.  
Data is small enough to reside at same place on Github, with notebooks.  
Data can link to URL if large, download but saved for next time notebook is run.
