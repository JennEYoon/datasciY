How to show jupyter notebooks on website?  
HTML viewer for non-coders, HR people.  
Github for clone, but also download from website, so don't need to clone whole repo.  
Mayve move all non-website file out again?  

Maybe a separate repo just for project notebooks???  
With MyBinder and CoLab option  
With related files somehow open in Colab notebooks.  

 * Public data file link: can use datasciY, already have public URL.  
   Or AWS S3 public bucket, just for data - pay for transfer out fee - OK for small files.  
 * Shareable public link from Google Drive, faster to read from Colab (Google), OK seems good.  
   Find a way to read text files into CoLab from shareable link on Google Drive (public).  
   Can I mount a folder, use for all data files?  Yes.  from drive mount...

 * Also create collapsing headings - for subprojects.
