  * Git and GitHub:  
    - Finally somewhat comfortable with rebase, reset HEAD, edit history, remote force push, git clone, git add remote, and git merge feature branch. 
  * Got working hosted Jupyter notebooks/Hub via Google CoLab and MyBinder.org  
  * GitHub commit graph - July 19, 2020, 1-year history  
    - Got solid filled 1-year history, 16 days to go. 
    - Over 3648 commits in past year. 
  * SO got over 500 pts in 2019.  
    - To get another 500 points in 2020.  
    - Got bonus 109 pts, from people voting up my earlier answers. 
    - To get back to it this Fall, reach 1000 pts by Nov 2020. 
  * Markdown formatting -- finally feel comfortable with text formatting, bullets, bold, code tick marks, quote block.  Also insert html link, image link with sizing HTML codes, image link wihtout sizing markdown.  
  * VS Code editor -- how to select python engine, format code, indent, tab/html edit, run on selected python terminal, run on ipython interface, view markdown, view jupyter notebook, export as jupyter notebook, etc.  
  * Jupyter Notebook -- how to use, markdown edit, select cells, run connected python module, refresh imported module  
  * Python package management, installing, importing, updating, reload, run, %run automatically re-run, Ubuntu and Win versions  
  * Basic webdev, html, css, frameworks, css grid, hosting on Amazon, email redirect for jyoon@10sigmarisk.com  - 2017 first half year.  
  * Read Javascript the Good Parts, started practice with Head First Javascript.  

#### Python & ML:  
  * Finally seem to have a firm fix on class obj.  
    - what is class-wide constant
    - what is initialized with each instance, private constants, variabes
    - WHen to use () to call function, create class object.  
    - Format for passing variables to class instance, updating class instance variable. 
    - Inherit from base class to sub class.  Use () in class creation.  
    - Call class() to create instance of class object.  
  * Reasonably good with Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot 
    - could use more recent practice  
  * Familiar with Pandas
  * Started on sk-learn 
  * Started on tensorflow v 2. 
  * Reasonably good understanding of Machine Learning, before deep-learning.  
  * Medium level on Deep-Learning, Coursera.org halfway.  
  * Started learning about Python-MySQL-Connector, already know SQL language.  
  * Got SO practice on usign Excel with Python, manipulating objects from python module.

  * ngram post to DatasciY.com, 
  * Good Habits, Bad Habits book reading. 
  * Fluent Python book reading.  
    Very low level concept takes a long time to sink in.  
    Need to understand enough of language structures to mentally group items together.  Need to be able to group like items together to aid in memory.  Motivation also helps remember.  When I need to remember code words and syntax to use on the job soon, gives me more motivation to remember.  

#### MyBinder/notebooks moved, 6/14/2020 1:30 AM   
   Keep on Github "notebooks-old" repo.  Converted to Private.  
   If whole repo is deleted, will also remove commit history counts.  
   Unless I can figure out how to "merge commit history", don't touch.  
   
#### June 15, 2020 WIP MyBinder.org image for datasciY.com  
  * MyBinder needs Github repo to work, not just any public URL.  
  * Keep getting 503 Error, host down.  
  * Moved all items to root of **datasciY repo** .
  
#### June 19, 2020 WIP:  
  * working on FluentPy frenchdeck, class creation, examples.  
  * start researching MySQL use with Python  
  * start researching JavaScript and jQuery for datasciY.com demos.  
  * watching DLAI classes 3, 4, and 5. meetup small group at class 4 wk 2 (maybe 1 repeat) for July.  
  * prep for SciPy 2020 virtual in few weeks.  
  * 6/20/2020 - changed Github profile photo to recent, good job with cropp background and blur edge.  Used Paint and watercolor brush to blur, color picker.  
  * 6/23-35, 2020 -- Change Github default  branch name from "master" to "main."  
    (Finished datasciY, SECdataPy, deep-learning, learn-mldl, git-practice)
  ---  
  * Definitely need to file taxes for 2017, 2018, 2019 - get stimulus money!!!  
  * car - finish registering soon.
