#### How to show jupyter notebooks on website?  

  * HTML viewer for non-coders, HR people. -- registered with NBViewer, Jupyter hub.  
    https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/  
    
  * Github for clone or download (whole repo only, no partial option)  
    Maybe move all non-website folders out again? But why would anyone want to clone the whole website repo?   
    Moved out 3 folders -> SECdataPy repo, private.  
    
  * Download individual files from datasciY.com on AWS, small files only <15 MB, otherwise transfer out fees apply.  
    http://datasciY.com/projects/name/data.*
  
  * Large data files, download from Google Drive with shareable link.  
    C:\Users\jyoon\gdrive\Colab Notebooks\data-large\    
    Or provide original data source URL.  
    
Maybe a separate repo just for project notebooks   
  - https://github.com/JennEYoon/notebooks-hosted  
  - With MyBinder and CoLab option  
  - With related files in same repo  
  - Large files - Google Drive shareable link, or Original Source URL   

 * Public data file link: can use datasciY, already have public URL.  
   Or AWS S3 public bucket, just for data - pay for transfer out fee - OK for small files.  
 * Shareable public link from Google Drive, faster to read from Colab (Google), OK seems good.  
   Find a way to read text files into CoLab from shareable link on Google Drive (public).  
   Can I mount a folder, use for all data files?  Yes.  from drive mount...

 * Also create collapsing headings - for subprojects.
