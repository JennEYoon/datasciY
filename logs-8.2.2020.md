   Watched several interviews, impressed again.  
   Time to revisit it after going through Andrew Ng's deep learning series?  
   - Try doing 3 Kaggle competitions, learn how to connect with data, move model to cloud, clean large data ... 
   - Run the notebook cells myself, then try to reproduce the notebook without looking at it, takes time.  
     Look up definitions.  
   - In July 2018 when I first came across it, I didn"t have 1 year of solid Python coding experience.  Now I do & know more about ML and DL.

#### Sept 2020      
    
  * 9/6 Sun finished YOLO videos, had to review several times.  
    Notebook - to do.  
    Training set needs bounding box marked by humans.  
    sliding window vs YOLO whick use grid. Kind of parallel all grids processed simultaneously.  
    Still need processors, but in parallel instead of sequentially.  
    \-  
  * YOLO post poned to 9/15 Tu 7pm. Do notebook by then.    
  * YOLO notebook to finish Friday 9/11. 
    \-
  * 0/12-9/13 3:30 am -- finally figured out how to download Coursera class zip files.  
    Use **tor**  
    Data files too large to push to Github, some weeks.

#### Projects WIP 9/3/2020 00:30 - 4:45 AM  

How to show jupyter notebooks on website?  
HTML viewer for non-coders, HR people.  
Github for clone, but also download from website, so don't need to clone whole repo.  
Mayve move all non-website file out again?  

Maybe a separate repo just for project notebooks???  
With MyBinder and CoLab option  
With related files somehow open in Colab notebooks.  

 * Public data file link: can use datasciY, already have public URL.  
   Or AWS S3 public bucket, just for data - pay for transfer out fee - OK for small files.  
 * Shareable public link from Google Drive, faster to read from Colab (Google), OK seems good.  
   Find a way to read text files into CoLab from shareable link on Google Drive (public).  
   Can I mount a folder, use for all data files?  Yes.  from drive mount...

 * Also create collapsing headings - for subprojects.
