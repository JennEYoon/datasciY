Data 0) pre-processed from author, saved to PyTorch  .pt format  

A common PyTorch convention is to save models using either a .pt or .pth file extension.  
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html  

1. torch.save: Saves a serialized object to disk. This function uses Python’s pickle utility for serialization. Models, tensors, and dictionaries of all kinds of objects can be saved using this function.

2. torch.load: Uses pickle’s unpickling facilities to deserialize pickled object files to memory. This function also facilitates the device to load the data into (see Saving & Loading Model Across Devices).

3. torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict: Loads a model’s parameter dictionary using a deserialized state_dict. For more information on state_dict, see What is a state_dict?.

MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database expanded (Feb. 24, 2005, midnight)
The entire MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is now freely available on PhysioNet. Somewhat more than half of the database has been available here since PhysioNet's inception; the remainder has now been posted.

PTB Diagnostic ECG Database (Sept. 25, 2004, midnight)

New in PhysioBank is the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, a collection of 549 high-resolution 15-lead ECGs (12 standard leads together with Frank XYZ leads), including clinical summaries for each record. From one to five ECG records are available for each of the 294 subjects, who include healthy subjects as well as patients with a variety of heart diseases.
