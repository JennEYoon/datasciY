Aretaeus (Greek: Ἀρεταῖος) is one of the most celebrated of the ancient Greek physicians. Little is known of his life. He presumably was a native or at least a citizen of Cappadocia, a Roman province in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey), and most likely lived in the second half of the second century AD.[1] He is generally styled "the Cappadocian" (Καππάδοξ).  

ARETE was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of virtue, excellence, goodness and valour. She was depicted as a fair woman of high bearing, dressed in white. Her opposite number was the daimona Kakia (Cacia), lady of vice.
