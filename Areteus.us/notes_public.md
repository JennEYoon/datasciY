> Fallback: Use not-live data.  Use Hospital ECG from Mexico data, to show AI part works.  Show device data separately that may not be clean.
> Fallback: Use someone else's device with 2 or more leads, or buy 2 devices used together with 1-lead each, get data, showcase AI part works.
> Fallback: Use live data from only 2 of Jason's 12-19 lead, use "live" to showcase proof of concept, device and AI works.
