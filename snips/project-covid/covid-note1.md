### The coronavirus has laid bare the inequalities of American public health.  
https://time.com/5887432/coronavirus-united-states-failure/  

Life expectancy split into income brackets and geographys in US.  

Even the government’s decision to cover coronavirus-related treatment costs has ended up in confusion and fear among lower income patients thanks to our dysfunctional medical billing system.  
I won't be surprised if unscrupulous medical hospitals are sending bills for thousands of dollars to poor patients after discharge.  

[Another epidemic laid bare this Summer,] racially motivated police violence: the U.S. has not adequately addressed its legacy of racism.

There’s another disturbing undercurrent to Americans’ attitude toward the pandemic thus far: **a seeming willingness to accept mass death** [As long as it's other people]. As a nation we may have become dull to horrors that come our way as news, from gun violence to the seemingly never-ending incidents of police brutality to the water crises in Flint, Mich., and elsewhere. Americans seem to have already been inured to the idea that other Americans will die regularly, when they do not need to.  

China, India also does not consider everyone in their country to be deserving of the same.  Only their class or kin group is worthy.  
South Korea talks about people of qualit, and you can accidentally kill someone and pay it off with money, 5-10 thousand dollars.  
Narative Economics - Feelings of solidarity grows during periods of jointly experienced Depression, main example 1930's.  

It is difficult to quantify apathy. But what else could explain that nearly half a year in, we still haven’t figured out how to equip the frontline workers who, in trying to save the lives of others, are putting their own lives at risk? What else could explain why 66% of Americans—roughly 217.5 million people—still aren’t always wearing masks in public?  

Each one of those lives lost represents an entire world, not only of those individuals but also of their family, friends, colleagues and loved ones. This is humbling—and it should be. The only path forward is one of humility, of recognition that if America is exceptional with regard to COVID-19, it’s in a way most people would not celebrate.
