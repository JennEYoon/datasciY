#### Notes - Jupyter Notebooks based blog posts -- exported via fastpages  

http://fastpages.fast.ai  
Jupyter notebooks export into blog web pages using **fastpages** template tool.  
Blog posts need to be in root sub "_notebooks" folder.  

fastpages has a lot of stuff.  
Use "nbdev" only first. Need Githib.io pages to work?  
Cant't host on AWS.  But can link to pages hosted on Gothub.io pages from datasciY.com.
